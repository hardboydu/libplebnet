.Sh NAME
.Nm mknetid
.Nd "generate netid map data"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mknetid
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl g Ar group_file
.Op Fl p Ar passwd_file
.Op Fl h Ar hosts_file
.Op Fl n Ar netid_file
.Op Fl d Ar domain
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Mknetid
processes the contents of the
.Xr group 5 ,
.Xr passwd 5 ,
.Xr hosts 5 and
.Xr netid 5
files into the format used to generate the
.Pa netid.byname
NIS map. This map is used to hold credential information for both users
and hosts in a operating system independent format.
.Pp
The
.Nm mknetid
command checks for duplicate occurances of netids and filters
them out.
.Pp
The
.Nm mknetid
command prints its results on the standard output. It is usually called
only by
.Nm /var/yp/Makefile
when rebuilding the NIS maps.
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
The
.Nm mknetid
command supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl q
Normally,
.Nm mknetid
prints a warning message when it encounters a duplicate netid.
This flag turns on 'quiet' mode, allowing the warnings to be
surpressed. Other error messages may still be generated.
.It Fl g Ar group-file
The
.Fl g
flag can be used to specify the location of the group information
file. The compiled-in default is
.Pa /etc/group .
.It Fl p Ar passwd-file
The
.Fl p
flag can be used to specify the location of the passwd information
file. The compiled-in default is
.Pa /etc/passwd .
.It Fl h Ar group-file
The
.Fl h
flag can be used to specify the location of the hosts database
file. The compiled-in default is
.Pa /etc/hosts .
.It Fl n Ar netid-file
The
.Fl n
flag can be used to specify the location of the netid information
file. The compiled-in default is
.Pa /etc/netid .
Note that no error is generated if the netid database can't be
found. The netid database is not likely to be present on most systems
until Secure RPC support is added to FreeBSD.
.It Fl d Ar domain
By default, the
.Nm mknetid
command uses the system domainname when generating netid records. If
the system domainnameis not set, the domain must be specified on the
command line with the
.Fl d
flag. If the domainname is set, the
.Fl d
flag may be used to override it.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact
.It Pa /var/yp/Makefile
The Makefile that calls
.Nm yp_mkdb
and
.Nm mknetid
to build the NIS databases.
.It Pa /etc/group
The default group database file.
.It Pa /etc/passwd
The default passwd database file.
.It Pa /etc/hosts
The default hosts database file.
.It Pa /etc/netid
The default netid database file.
