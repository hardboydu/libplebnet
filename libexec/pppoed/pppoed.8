.Sh NAME
.Nm pppoed
.Nd handle incoming PPP over Ethernet connections
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Fd
.Op Fl P Ar pidfile
.Op Fl a Ar name
.Op Fl e Ar exec
.Op Fl n Ar ngdebug
.Op Fl p Ar provider
.Ar interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program listens to the given
.Ar interface
for PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) service request packets, and actions them
by negotiating a session then envoking a
.Em PPP
program.  The negotiation is implemented by the
.Dq pppoe
netgraph node.  See
.Xr ng_pppoe 8
for details.
.Pp
.Nm
will only offer services to clients requesting services from the given
.Ar provider ,
which is taken as an empty name if not provided.
If a provider name of
.Dq \&*
is given, any PPPoE requests will be offered service.
.Pp
The supplied
.Ar name
will be given as the access concentrator name when establishing the
connection.  If no
.Ar name
is given, the current base hostname is used.
.Pp
After receiving a request (PADI) from the PPPoE netgraph node,
.Nm
.Xr fork 2 Ns No s
a child process and returns to service further requests.  The child process
offers service
.Pq using Ar name
and waits for a
.Dv SUCCESS
indication from the PPPoE node.  On receipt of the SUCCESS indication,
.Nm 
will execute
.Pp
.D1 Ic exec /usr/sbin/ppp -direct Ar provider
.Pp
as a shell sub-process.  It is possible to specify another command using the
.Ar exec
argument.  This is mandatory if
.Ar provider
is not given.  The child process will have standard input and standard output
attached to the same
.Xr netgraph 4
data socket
.Pq see Xr ng_socket 8
when started.
.Pp
Upon invocation,
.Nm
will attach a
.Dq pppoe
netgraph node to the relevant
.Dq ether
node using
.Dq Ar interface Ns No \&:
as the node name, and then connect that
.Dq pppoe
node to a local
.Dq socket
node.  If the
.Fl F
flag has not been given,
.Nm
will then go into the background and disassociate itself from the controlling
terminal.  When the
.Fl F
flag is given,
.Nm
stays in the foreground.
.Pp
If the
.Fl d
flag is given, additional diagnostics are provided (see the
.Sx DIAGNOSTICS
section below).
If the
.Fl n
flag is given,
.Fn NgSetDebug
is called with an argument of
.Ar ngdebug .
.Pp
If
.Ar pidfile
is given,
.Nm
will write its process ID to this file on startup.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
After creating the necessary
.Xr netgraph 4
nodes as described above,
.Nm
uses
.Xr syslogd 8
to report all incoming connections.  If the
.Fl d
flag is given,
.Nm
will report on the child processes creation of a new netgraph socket, it's
service offer and the invocation of the
.Em PPP
program.
If the
.Fl n
option is given, netgraph diagnostic messages are also redirected to
.Xr syslogd 8 .
.Pp
It is sometimes useful to add the following to
.Pa /etc/syslog.conf :
.Pp
.Dl !pppoed
.Dl *.*				/var/log/pppoed.log
.Pp
and the following to
.Pa /etc/newsyslog.conf :
.Pp
.Dl /var/log/pppoed.log			640  3	   100	*     Z

.Sh BUGS
If another netgraph node is using the given interface,
.Nm
will fail to start.  This is because
.Xr netgraph 4
does not currently allow node chaining.  This may change in the future.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program was written by 
.An Brian Somers Aq brian@Awfulhak.org
and first appeared in
.Fx 3.4 .
