.Sh DESCRIPTION
The commands
.Nm bcd ,
.Nm ppt
and
.Nm morse
read the given input and reformat it in the form of punched cards,
paper tape or morse code respectively.
Acceptable input are command line arguments or the standard input.
.Pp
Available option:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl s
The
.Fl s
option for morse produces dots and dashes rather than words.
.It Fl p
Send morse the real way. This only works if your system has sound
support and if the program understands your audio hardware.
.It Fl w Ar speed
Set the sending speed in words per minute. If not specified the default
speed of 20 WPM is used.
.It Fl f Ar frequency
Set the sidetone frequency to something other than the default 600 Hz.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl w
and
.Fl f
flags only work in conjunction with the
.Fl p
flag.
.Pp
Not all prosigns have corresponding characters. Use
.Ql #
for
.Em AS ,
.Ql @
for 
.Em SK ,
.Ql *
for
.Em VE
and
.Ql %
for
.Em BK .
The more common prosigns are
.Ql =
for
.Em BT ,
.Ql (
for
.Em KN
and
.Ql +
for
.Em AR .

.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width LC_CTYPE
.It Ev LC_CTYPE
.It Ev LANG
If one of these variables is set to a locale ending in
.Ql KOI8-R ,
characters with the high-order bit set are being interpreted as
cyrillic characters.  In all other cases, they are being interpreted
as belonging to the
.Ql ISO_8859-1
character set.
.Sh HISTORY
Sound support added by Lyndon Nerenberg (VE7TCP/VE6BBM) <lyndon@orthanc.com>.
.Sh BUGS
Does only understand a few European characters (namely German and
French), but neither Asian ones, or the continental landline code.
.Pp
Sends a bit slower than it should due to system overhead. Some people
would call this a feature.
