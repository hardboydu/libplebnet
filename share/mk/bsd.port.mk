#
# Supported Variables and their behaviors:
#
# Variables that typically apply to all ports:
# 
# PORTSDIR	- The root of the ports tree (default: /usr/ports).
# DISTDIR 	- Where to get gzip'd, tarballed copies of original sources
#		- (default: ${PORTSDIR}/distfiles.
# PACKAGES	- A top level directory where all packages go (rather than
#		- going someplace locally). (default: ${PORTSDIR}/packages).
# GMAKE		- Set to path of GNU make if not in $PATH (default: gmake).
# XMKMF		- Set to path of `xmkmf' if not in $PATH (default: xmkmf).
#
# Variables that typically apply to an individual port:
#
# WRKDIR 	- A temporary working directory that gets *clobbered* on clean.
# WRKSRC	- A subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where the distribution actually
#		  unpacks to.  Defaults to ${WRKDIR}/${DISTNAME}.
# DISTNAME	- Name of port or distribution.
# PATCHDIR 	- A directory containing required patches.
# SCRIPTDIR 	- A directory containing auxilliary scripts.
# FILESDIR 	- A directory containing any miscellaneous additional files.
# PKGDIR 	- Package creation files.
#
# NO_EXTRACT	- Use a dummy (do-nothing) extract target.
# NO_CONFIGURE	- Use a dummy (do-nothing) configure target.
# NO_BUILD	- Use a dummy (do-nothing) build target.
# NO_PACKAGE	- Use a dummy (do-nothing) package target.
# NO_INSTALL	- Use a dummy (do-nothing) install target.
# USE_GMAKE	- Says that the port uses gmake.
# USE_IMAKE	- Says that the port uses imake.
# HAS_CONFIGURE	- Says that the port has its own configure script.
# CONFIGURE_ARGS - Pass these args to configure, if $HAS_CONFIGURE.
# HOME_LOCATION	- site/path name (or user's email address) describing
#		  where this port came from or can be obtained if the
#		  tarball is missing.
# DEPENDS	- A list of other ports this package depends on being
#		  made first, relative to ${PORTSDIR} (e.g. x11/tk, lang/tcl,
#		  etc).
# 
#
# Default targets and their behaviors:
#
# extract	- Unpacks ${DISTDIR}/${DISTNAME}.tar.gz into ${WRKDIR}.
# configure	- Applys patches, if any, and runs either GNU configure, one
#		  or more local configure scripts or nothing, depending on
#		  what's available.
# build		- Actually compile the sources.
# install	- Install the results of a build.
# package	- Create a package from a build.
# bundle	- From an unextracted source tree, re-create tarballs.
