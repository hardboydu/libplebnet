#
# Supported Variables and their behaviors:
#
# GMAKE		- Set to path of GNU make if not in $PATH.
# DISTDIR 	- Where to get gzip'd, tarballed copies of original sources.
# DISTNAME	- Name of package or distribution.
# WRKDIR 	- A temporary working directory that gets *clobbered* on clean.
# WRKSRC	- A subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where the distribution actually
#		  unpacks to.  Defaults to ${WRKDIR}/${DISTNAME}.
# PATCHDIR 	- A directory containing required patches.
# SCRIPTDIR 	- A directory containing auxilliary scripts.
# FILESDIR 	- A directory containing any miscellaneous additional files.
# PKGDIR 	- Package creation files.
#
# USE_GMAKE	- Says that the package uses gmake (*).
# HAS_CONFIGURE	- Says that the package has its own configure script (*).
# CONFIGURE_ARGS - Pass these args to configure, if $HAS_CONFIGURE.
# HOME_LOCATION	- site/path name (or user's email address) describing
#		  where this package came from or can be obtained if the
#		  tarball is missing.
# DEPENDS	- A list of other packages this package depends on being
#		  made first.
# 
#
# Default targets and their behaviors:
#
# extract	- Unpacks ${DISTDIR}/${DISTNAME}.tar.gz into ${WRKDIR}.
# configure	- Applys patches, if any, and runs either GNU configure, a
#		  local configure or nothing, depending on settings.
# build		- Actually compile the sources.
# install	- Install the results of a build.
# package	- Create a package from a build.
