<sect>Introduction

<p>
This is an SGML example file using the Linuxdoc-SGML DTD. You can format it 
using the command
<tscreen><verb>
$ format -Tnroff | qroff | pg
</verb></tscreen>
this will produce plain ASCII. You can also produce LaTeX, and (soon) HTML
and Texinfo.

<sect>The source

<p>
Looking at the source for this file will be instructive to show you how
to use many of the Linuxdoc-SGML constructs. You should also read the
<em/Linuxdoc-SGML User's Guide/, in the file <tt/guide.sgml/.

The source looks and feels like LaTeX, as you can see. Paragraphs are
separated by blank lines, macros are enclosed in angle brackets. It's 
quite simple. 

<sect>Some examples

<p>
Here are examples of things that you'll be using in the source. First,
let's decend into a subsection:

<sect1>This is a subsection

<p>
As the header says. Note that you need to use the <tt/p/ command to
start the body of the section, after the <tt/sect1/ command.
Here's a subsubsection:

<sect2>This is a subsubsection

<p>
Right. 5 levels of sections are available. Use the commands
<tt/sect/, <tt/sect1/, <tt/sect2/, <tt/sect3/, and <tt/sect4/ to get them.
This document uses the <tt>article</> document style, which is 
appropriate for HOWTOs and other docs; the <tt>report</> style (which 
includes the <tt/chapt/ sectioning command) should be used for the LDP docs. 

<sect1>Example text

<p>
All right, so you're typing along, and you want to show some example code,
or example I/O with a program, whatever. Use the <tt/code/ or <tt/verb/
``environments'' for this, wrapped in a <tt/tscreen/ environment, as so:
<tscreen><verb>
This is an example verb environment.
</verb></tscreen>
As well as:
<tscreen><code>
This is an example code environment.
</code></tscreen>
The <tt/tscreen/ environment just sets the font to small type and 
indents it nicely. It's not required for using <tt/verb/ or <tt/code/,
but I suggest that you do. 

The <em/Linuxdoc-SGML User's Guide/ explains what special characters you
can and can't use in the <tt/verb/ and <tt/code/ environments. 

<sect1><heading>Cross references<label id="test-ref"></>

<p>
What about cross-references? This section has been marked with the
<tt>label</> command; using <tt>ref</> will provide a cross reference,
as in ``See Section <ref id="test-ref">'' for more. 

Right now cross-references don't work in the <tt/nroff/ translation for 
plain ASCII.

<sect1>Using fonts

<p>
You want fonts, we got fonts. Of course these won't show up in the
plain ASCII text, but they all map into the various output formats:
<bf/boldface/, <em/emphasis/, <sf/sans serif/, <sl/slanted/,
<tt/typewriter/, and <it/italics/.

<sect1>Lists

<p>
Lists are easy as well. Just use the <tt/itemize/ element with the
<tt/item/ commands, seen here:
<itemize>
<item> This is a list.
<item> Nothing exciting about that.
       <itemize> 
       <item> Multiple levels are supported as well.
       <item> Again, that's no surprise.
       </itemize>
       <enum>
       <item> Enumerated lists using <tt>enum</> also work.
       <item> Description environments using <tt>descrip</> along
	      with <tt>tag</> are also available, as seen here.
       </enum>
       <descrip>
       <tag/First item./ Here's one item.
       <tag/Second item./ Here's another.
       <tag/Third item./ Can we go for three?
       </descrip>
<item> A final item to top it all off.
</itemize>

This is just about everything that you need to get started with
writing SGML docs using the <tt/linuxdoc-sgml/ DTD. Please let me know
if you think something should be changed or added to this document.
