# This file, if present, will be read by make (see /usr/share/mk/sys.mk).
# It allows you to override macro definitions to make without changing
# your source tree, or anything the source tree installs.
#
# This file must be in valid Makefile syntax.
#
# You have to find the things you can put here in the Makefiles and 
# documentation of the source tree.
#
# One, and probably the most common, use could be:
#
#CFLAGS= -O2 -m486 -pipe
#
# Another useful entry is
#
#NOPROFILE=	true
#	Avoid compiling profiled libraries
#
# To have 'obj' symlinks created in your source directory
#       (they aren't needed/necessary)
#OBJLINK=	yes
#
# To compile the kernel with special optimisations, you can use this:
#
#COPTFLAGS= -O -pipe
#
# To compile and install the 4.4 lite libm instead of the default use:
#
#WANT_CSRG_LIBM=	yes
#
# If you do not want unformatted manual pages to be compressed
# when they are installed:
#
#NOMANCOMPRESS=	true
#
#
# If you want the "compat" shared libraries installed as part of your normal
# builds, uncomment these:
#
#COMPAT1X=	yes
#COMPAT20=	yes
#COMPAT21=	yes
#
#
# If you do not want additional documentation (some of which are
# a few hundred KB's) for ports to be installed:
#
#NOPORTDOCS=	true
#
#
# Default format for system documentation, depends on your printer.
# Set this to "ascii" for simple printers or screen
#
#PRINTERDEVICE=	ps
#
#
# How long to wait for a console keypress before booting the default kernel.
# This value is approximately in milliseconds. Keypresses are accepted by the
# BIOS before booting from disk, making it possible to give custom boot
# parameters even when this is set to 0.
#
#BOOTWAIT=0
#BOOTWAIT=30000
#
# By default, the system will always use the keyboard/video card as system
# console.  However, the boot blocks may be dynamically configured to use a
# serial port in addition to or instead of the keyboard/video console.
#
# By default we use COM1 as our serial console port *if* we're going to use
# a serial port as our console at all.  (0x3E8 = COM2)
#
#BOOT_COMCONSOLE_PORT=	0x3F8
#
# The default serial console speed is 9600.  Set the speed to a larger value
# for better interactive response.
#
#BOOT_COMCONSOLE_SPEED=	115200
#
#
# By default, this points to /usr/X11R6 for XFree86 releases 3.0 or earlier.
# If you have a XFree86 from before 3.0 that has the X distribution in
# /usr/X386, you want to uncomment this.
#
#X11BASE=	/usr/X386
#
#
# If you have Motif on your system, uncomment this.
#
#HAVE_MOTIF=	yes
#
# If the default location of the Motif library (specified below) is NOT
# appropriate for you, uncomment this and change it to the correct value.
# If your motif is in ${X11BASE}/lib, you don't need to touch this line.
#
#MOTIFLIB=	-L${X11BASE}/lib -lXm
#
#
# If you are running behind a firewall, uncomment the following to leave a
# hint for various make-spawned utilities that they should use passive FTP.
#
#FTP_PASSIVE_MODE=	YES
#
#
# Port master sites.
#
# If you want your port fetches to go somewhere else than the default
# (specified below) in case the distfile/patchfile was not found,
# uncomment this and change it to a location nearest you.  (Don't
# remove the "/${DIST_SUBDIR}/" part.)
#
#MASTER_SITE_BACKUP?=	\
#	ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/distfiles/${DIST_SUBDIR}/
#
# If you want your port fetches to check the above site first (before
# the MASTER_SITES specified in the port Makefiles), uncomment the
# line below.  You can also change the right side to point to wherever 
# you want.
#
#MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE?=	${MASTER_SITE_BACKUP}
#
# Some ports use a special variable to point to a collection of
# mirrors of well-known software archives.  If you have a mirror close
# to you, uncomment any of the following lines and change it to that
# address.  (Don't remove the "/${MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR}/" part.)
#
# Note: the right hand sides of the following lines are only for your
# information.  For a full list of default sites, take a look at
# bsd.port.mk.
