NOTE:  The LKM mechanism is now deprecated in favor of the superior KLD
mechanism as of FreeBSD 3.0-RELEASE.  These examples are provided purely
for historical reasons and you should see the ../kld directory if you're
interested in actually writing a dynamically-loadable extention to the
kernel for any reasonably modern release of FreeBSD.  - jkh
