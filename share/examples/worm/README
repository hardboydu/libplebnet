These two shell scripts are what the developers use to burn CDs,
including the FreeBSD releases made for Walnut Creek CDROM.

makecdfs.sh is used to turn an arbitrary tree of files into a single
ISO9660 (with RockRidge extensions) filesystem image.  See the top
of the shell script for usage instructions.

burncd.sh takes the filesystem image produced by makecdfs.sh and burns
it onto an HP 4020i CDR drive (see script for information on customizing
it to other types of CDR drives).

It's that simple!
