# This file contains all of the "CVSUP collections" that comprise the FreeBSD
# ports collection tree.  CVSup (CVS Update Protocol) allows you to download
# the latest cvs tree (or any branch of development therefrom) to your
# system easily and efficiently (far more so than with sup, which CVSup
# is aimed at replacing).  If you're running CVSup interactively, and are
# currently using an X display server, you should run CVSup as follows to
# keep your ports tree up-to-date:
#
#	cvsup ports-supfile
#
# If not running X, or invoking cvsup from a non-interactive script, then
# run it as follows:
#
#	cvsup -g -L 2 ports-supfile
#
# You may want to change some of the settings in this file to better
# suit your system:
#
# base=/usr	
#		base specifies the root where SUP will store information
#		about the collections you have transferred to your system.
#		A setting of "/usr" will generate this information in
#		/usr/sup.  Even if you are SUPing a large number of
#		collections, you will be hard pressed to generate more than
#		~1MB of data in this directory.
#
# prefix=/usr/ports
#		prefix specifies where to place the requested files.  A
#		setting of "/usr/ports" will place the all of the files
#		requested in /usr/ports (ie /usr/ports/devel, /usr/ports/cad).
#		The directory that is the prefix must exist in order for
#		SUP to transfer files successfully.

# There are two ways to sup the latest ports.  One is to use the individual
# collections, and the other is to use the "ports-all" mega-collection,
# which includes everything except ports-distfile.

# ports-all and distfiles.  Note that the distfiles collection is HUGE,
# you will need a big disk and a good network connection to keep up.
