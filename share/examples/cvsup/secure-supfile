# This file contains all of the "CVSup collections" that comprise the FreeBSD
# International secure distribution from the current (new and experimental)
# branch.  CVSup (CVS Update Protocol) allows you to syncronize your system
# sources with the latest secure source distribution easily and efficiently
# (far more so than with sup, which CVSup is aimed at replacing).  If you're
# running CVSup interactively, and are currently using an X display server,
# you should run CVSup as follows to keep your secure source tree up-to-date:
#
#	cvsup secure-supfile
#
# If not running X, or invoking cvsup from a non-interactive script, then
# run it as follows:
#
#	cvsup -g -L 2 secure-supfile
#
# If your network link is ISDN or slower, you'll save time by using
# compression.  Either add the "-z" option to the cvsup command line,
# or add the "compress" keyword to each collection in this supfile.
#
# You may want to change some of the settings in this file to better
# suit your system:
#
# base=/usr	
#		base specifies the root where CVSup will store information
#		about the collections you have transferred to your system.
#		A setting of "/usr" will generate this information in
#		/usr/sup.  Even if you are CVSupping a large number of
#		collections, you will be hard pressed to generate more than
#		~1MB of data in this directory.
#
# prefix=/usr
#		prefix specifies where to place the requested files.  A
#		setting of "/usr" will place the all of the files
#		requested in /usr/src (ie /usr/src/eBones, /usr/src/secure).
#		The directory that is the prefix must exist in order for
#		CVSup to transfer files successfully.
