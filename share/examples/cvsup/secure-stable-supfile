# This file contains all of the "CVSup collections" that make up the
# source tree of the FreeBSD-stable international secure distribution.
# If you are outside the USA or Canada, use this file.
#
# CVSup (CVS Update Protocol) allows you to download the latest CVS
# tree (or any branch of development therefrom) to your system easily
# and efficiently (far more so than with sup, which CVSup is aimed
# at replacing).  If you're running CVSup interactively, and are
# currently using an X display server, you should run CVSup as follows
# to keep your CVS tree up-to-date:
#
#	cvsup secure-stable-supfile
#
# If not running X, or invoking cvsup from a non-interactive script, then
# run it as follows:
#
#	cvsup -g -L 2 secure-stable-supfile
#
# You may wish to change some of the settings in this file to better
# suit your system:
#
# base=/usr
#		This specifies the root where CVSup will store information
#		about the collections you have transferred to your system.
#		A setting of "/usr" will generate this information in
#		/usr/sup.  Even if you are CVSupping a large number of
#		collections, you will be hard pressed to generate more than
#		~1MB of data in this directory.  You can override the
#		"base" setting on the command line with cvsup's "-b base"
#		option.  This directory must exist in order to run CVSup.
#
# prefix=/usr
#		This specifies where to place the requested files.  A
#		setting of "/usr" will place all of the files requested
#		in "/usr/src" (e.g., "/usr/src/crypto" and "/usr/src/secure").
#		The prefix directory must exist in order to run CVSup.

# Defaults that apply to all the collections
*default host=cvsup.internat.FreeBSD.org
*default base=/usr
*default prefix=/usr
# The following line is for 3-stable.  If you want 2.2-stable, change
# "RELENG_3" to "RELENG_2_2".
*default release=cvs tag=RELENG_3
*default delete use-rel-suffix

# If your network link is a T1 or faster, comment out the following line.
*default compress
