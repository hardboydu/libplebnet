# This file contains all of the "CVSUP collections" that comprise the FreeBSD
# International secure distribution from the stable (bug-fix only) development
# branch.  CVSup (CVS Update Protocol) allows you to syncronize your system
# sources with the latest version of this branch easily and efficiently (far
# more so than with sup, which CVSup is aimed at replacing).  If you're
# running CVSup interactively, and are currently using an X display server,
# you should run CVSup as follows to keep your stable tree up-to-date:
#
#	cvsup secure-stable-supfile
#
# If not running X, or invoking cvsup from a non-interactive script, then
# run it as follows:
#
#	cvsup -g -L 2 secure-stable-supfile
# 
# You may want to change some of the settings in this file to better
# suit your system:
#
# base=/usr	
#		base specifies the root where SUP will store information
#		about the collections you have transferred to your system.
#		A setting of "/usr" will generate this information in
#		/usr/sup.  Even if you are SUPing a large number of
#		collections, you will be hard pressed to generate more than
#		~1MB of data in this directory.
#
# prefix=/usr/src
#		prefix specifies where to place the requested files.  A
#		setting of "/usr/src" will place the all of the files
#		requested in /usr/src (ie /usr/src/eBones, /usr/src/secure).
#		The directory that is the prefix must exist in order for
#		SUP to transfer files successfully.
