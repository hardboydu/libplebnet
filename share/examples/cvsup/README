# $Id$

This directory contains sample "supfiles" for obtaining and updating
the FreeBSD sources via the Internet.  These supfiles will work
with CVSup version 14.0 or later.

To maintain the sources for the FreeBSD-current release, use these files:

    standard-supfile		Main source tree

    secure-supfile		International secure distribution
				(outside USA and Canada)

    ports-supfile		Ports collection

To maintain the sources for the FreeBSD-stable release, use these files:

    stable-supfile		Main source tree

    secure-stable-supfile	International secure distribution
				(outside USA and Canada)

To maintain a copy of the CVS repository containing all versions of
FreeBSD, use these files:

    cvs-supfile			Main source tree and ports collection

    secure-cvs-supfile		International secure distribution
				(outside USA and Canada)

The supfiles contained in this directory all obtain their updates
from cvsup.freebsd.org.  In order to reduce the load on that host,
please use one of the alternate CVSup servers listed below.

    USA:
	cvsup2.freebsd.org

    The Netherlands:
	cvsup.nl.freebsd.org
