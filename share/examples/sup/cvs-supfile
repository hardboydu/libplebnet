#
# This file contains all of the "SUP collections" that comprise the FreeBSD
# cvs development tree.  SUP (Software Update Protocol) allows you to
# download the latest cvs tree to your system easily.  SUP should be invoked
# as follows in order to keep the CVS tree up-to-date:
#
#	sup -v cvs-supfile
#
# See also /etc/make.conf, which can be customized to set the location
# if the supfile so that a `make update' in /usr/src will automatically
# invoke sup.
#
# You may wish to change some of the settings in this file to better
# suit your system:
#
# base=/usr	
#		base specifies the root where SUP will store information
#		about the collections you have transferred to your system.
#		A setting of "/usr" will generate this information in
#		/usr/sup.  Even if you are SUPing a large number of
#		collections, you will be hard pressed to generate more than
#		~1MB of data in this directory.
#
# prefix=/home/ncvs
#		prefix specifies where to place the requested files.  A
#		setting of "/home/ncvs" will place all of the files
#		requested in /home/ncvs (ie /home/ncvs/src/bin, 
#		/home/ncvs/ports archivers). The directory that is the
#		prefix must exist in order for SUP to transfer files
#		successfully.

## Ports Collection
#
# There are two ways to sup the latest ports.  One is to use the individual
# collections, and the other is to use the "ports-all" mega-collection,
# which includes all the ports-* collections.
