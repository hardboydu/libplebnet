# $FreeBSD$
#
# This file contains all of the "SUP collections" that comprise the FreeBSD
# source distribution from the stable (bug-fix only) development branch.
# SUP (Software Update Protocol) allows you to download the latest -stable
# tree to your system easily.  SUP should be invoked as follows in order to
# keep your -stable tree up-to-date:
#
#	sup -v stable-supfile
#
# See also /etc/make.conf, which can be customized to set the location
# if the supfile so that a `make update' in /usr/src will automatically
# invoke sup.
#
# You may want to change some of the settings in this file to better
# suit your system:
#
# base=/usr	
#		base specifies the root where SUP will store information
#		about the collections you have transferred to your system.
#		A setting of "/usr" will generate this information in
#		/usr/sup.  Even if you are SUPing a large number of
#		collections, you will be hard pressed to generate more than
#		~1MB of data in this directory.
#
# prefix=/usr/src
#		prefix specifies where to place the requested files.  A
#		setting of "/usr/src" will place the all of the files
#		requested in /usr/src (ie /usr/src/bin, /usr/src/share).
#		The directory that is the prefix must exist in order for
#		SUP to transfer files successfully.
