# This file contains all of the "SUP collections" that comprise the FreeBSD
# International secure distribution from the stable (bug-fix only) development
# branch.  SUP (Software Update Protocol) allows you to download the latest
# secure source distribution to your system easily.  SUP, available as a
# FreeBSD package or in the ports collection, should be invoked as:
#
#	sup -v secure-stable-supfile
#
# You may want to change some of the settings in this file to better
# suit your system:
#
# base=/usr	
#		base specifies the root where SUP will store information
#		about the collections you have transferred to your system.
#		A setting of "/usr" will generate this information in
#		/usr/sup.  Even if you are SUPing a large number of
#		collections, you will be hard pressed to generate more than
#		~1MB of data in this directory.
#
# prefix=/usr/src
#		prefix specifies where to place the requested files.  A
#		setting of "/usr/src" will place the all of the files
#		requested in /usr/src (ie /usr/src/eBones, /usr/src/secure).
#		The directory that is the prefix must exist in order for
#		SUP to transfer files successfully.
