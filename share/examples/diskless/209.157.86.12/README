    kernel, rc.local, and xdm-config are typically softlinks.  Plus other
    files, of course, depending on how you setup your system.

    rc.local and xdm-config might be softlinks into HT.DISKLESS, allowing
    you to ease system administration when managing many diskless
    workstations.  You can also play other tricks, such as I play in 
    rc.conf.local by having it source ../HT.DISKLESS/rc.conf.local to get
    class-based defaults.

    Note: the ttys file below contains an example of how to have X startup
    on boot.
