#
# example:
#	fofs.com		markl@shellx.best.com
#
#  NOTE: FORWARD.MAP can be used to override NDOMAIN.MAP for specific
#	 users.  NDOMAIN.MAP would then act as a catch-all 
#
#  NOTE: NDOMAIN.MAP only works to two levels.  I.E. if you have an
#	 entry for fubar.com, then user@fubar.com will work and
#	 user@host.fubar.com will work, but NOT user@host.dom.fubar.com
