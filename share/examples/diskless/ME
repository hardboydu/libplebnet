When templating, ME is typically a softlink to the appropriate host
subdirectory.  This softlink is different for each machine and
should not be updated by the template process.  Any system-wise configuration
file that needs to be personalized is typically turned into a softlink
through /conf/ME.  For example, /etc/rc.conf.local would be turned into a
softlink pointing to /conf/ME/rc.conf.local.

On any given machine, ME is typically a link to the hostname which also
exists as a subdirectory in the /conf directory.  So, for each machine you
do:

	cd /conf
	ln -s this_machines_name ME

The ME link is not used with diskless booting.  It is designed for templating
where each destination box has its own local disk.
