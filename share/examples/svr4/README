INSTALLATION OF compat_* ARCHIVES

This directory contains two .tar.gz archives used to populate /compat/svr4:

    compat_svr4.tar.gz    - generic SysVR4 distribution
    compat_sol26.tar.gz   - Solaris 2.6 and higher

Both archives assume that you have some form of SysVR4 distribution
mounted on /cdrom.  They should be extracted into your root directory.

compat_svr4.tar.gz is intended as a template for creating additional
OS-specific archives (as it happens, it also "just works" if you have
a Solaris 2.5 CD-ROM mounted on /cdrom).

compat_sol26.tar.gz is intended to cover the case where you have a 
Solaris 2.6 or Solaris 7 CD-ROM mounted on /cdrom and you don't wish
to copy the libraries onto your hard disk.

If you do wish to copy the libraries onto your hard disk, you should
start by extracting compat_svr4.tar.gz then removing the symlinks in
/compat/svr4/usr.  Then create /compat/svr4/usr/{lib,share,...} 
directories as needed, and copy your libraries, share-files and other
"required" objects into them (the definition of "required" will depend
on what, exactly, you wish to emulate).

There's a Solaris executable called "hello" in this directory which 
should produce "Hello, world!" on standard output if you have the
basics set up correctly.
