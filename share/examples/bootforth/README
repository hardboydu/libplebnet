Here you can find some simple examples how to use BootFORTH (part of the
new bootloader) together with terminal emulation code (available when
compiling /sys/boot/i386/libi386 with -DTERM_EMU).

Normally, you can place the files in /boot as they are here, and they will be
automatically loaded by /boot/loader.

The files are:

boot.4th	example of file which is always loaded by /boot/loader, if
		present in /boot/
screen.4th	helpful words for screen manipulation.
frames.4th	basic frame drawing primitives. Requires screen.4th.
menu.4th	example of simple startup menu.

You're encouraged to add more features to these files - I'm not a Forth
hacker, unfortunately...
