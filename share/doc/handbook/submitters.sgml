<chapt><heading>Contributing to FreeBSD<label id="submitters"></heading>

<p><em>Contributed by &a.jkh;.</em>

This guide is intended for those who are moderately familiar with
FreeBSD and have reached a point where they have some locally
developed customizations or fixes to the system which they'd like to
incorporate back into the mainstream sources. Submitting something to
the FreeBSD project ensures that you won't have to continually
reintegrate it with each subsequent release and is also an excellent
way of getting your code seriously <em>tested</em>!  Many people have
seen an original concept develop far beyond what they might have
originally envisioned simply due to the flood of feedback and ideas
generated by the many thousands of users of FreeBSD.  Contributions
are also what FreeBSD lives and grows from, so your contributions are
very important to the continued survival of this communal effort of
ours---we're very glad to see you reading this document!

Submissions to FreeBSD can generally be classified into four categories:
<enum>
<item>Ideas, general suggestions, bug reports.
<item>Changes to existing sources.
<item>Significant contribution of a large body of independent work.
<item>Porting of freely available software.
</enum>
A submission in <em>any</em> of these categories is highly welcomed as they
are each, in their own way, quite significant to the project.  


<sect><heading>Ideas and suggestions</heading>

<p>An idea, suggestion or fix can be communicated in one of the following ways:
<itemize>
	<item>An idea or suggestion of general technical interest should be
	  mailed to <tt>&lt;hackers@freebsd.org&gt;</tt>.  
          Likewise, people with an interest
	  in such things (and a tolerance for a <em>high</em>
	  volume of mail!) may
	  subscribe to the hackers mailing list by sending mail to 
          <tt>&lt;majordomo@freebsd.org&gt;</tt>.  
          See <ref id="eresources:mail" name="mailing lists">
	  for more information about this and other mailing lists.

	<item>An actual bug report should be filed by using the 
          <tt>send-pr(1)</tt> program.  This will prompt
	  you for various fields to fill in.  Simply go to the fields
	  surrounded by <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt>'s and fill in your own 
          information in place of
	  what's suggested there.  You should receive confirmation of your
	  bug report and a tracking number.  Keep this tracking number and use
	  it in any subsequent correspondence.
          If you do not receive confirmation in a timely fashion (3 days to
          a week, depending on your email connection) or are, for some
          reason, unable to use the <tt>send-pr(1)</tt> command,
	  then you may also file a bug report by sending mail to
          <tt>&lt;bugs@freebsd.org&gt;</tt>.
</itemize>

<sect><heading>Changes to the existing code</heading>

<p>An addition or change to the existing source code is a somewhat trickier
   affair and depends a lot on how far out of date you are with the current
   state of the core FreeBSD development.  There is a special on-going release
   of FreeBSD known as ``FreeBSD-current'' which is made available in
   a variety of ways for the convenience of developers working
   actively on the system.  See <ref id="current" name="Staying
   current with FreeBSD"> for more information about getting and using
   FreeBSD-current.

   Working from older sources unfortunately means that your changes may
   sometimes be too obsolete or too divergent for easy re-integration into
   FreeBSD.  Chances of this can be minimized somewhat by subscribing to the
   <tt>&lt;announce@freebsd.org&gt;</tt> and
   <tt>&lt;current@freebsd.org&gt;</tt> mailing lists, where discussions
   on the current state of the system take place.

   Assuming that you can manage to secure fairly up-to-date sources to base
   your changes on, the next step is to produce a set of diffs to send to the
   FreeBSD maintainers.  This is done with the <tt>diff(1)</tt> command,
   with the `context diff' form being preferred.  For example:
<tscreen><verb>
diff -c &lt;oldfile&gt &lt;newfile&gt;
</verb></tscreen>
or
<tscreen><verb>
diff -c -r &lt;olddir&gt &lt;newdir&gt;
</verb></tscreen>
   would generate such a set of context diffs for the given source file
   or directory hierarchy.  See the man page for <tt>diff(1)</tt> for more
   details.

   Once you have a set of diffs (which you may test with the
   <tt>patch(1)</tt> command), you should bundle them up in an
   email message and send it, along with a brief description of
   what the diffs are for, to
   <tt>&lt;hackers@freebsd.org&gt;</tt>.  Someone will very
   likely get back in touch with you in 24 hours or less,
   assuming of course that your diffs are interesting! :-)

   If your changes don't express themselves well as diffs alone
   (e.g. you've perhaps added, deleted or renamed files as well)
   then you may be better off bundling any new files, diffs and
   instructions for deleting/renaming others into a <tt>tar</tt>
   file and running the <tt>uuencode(1)</tt> program on it before
   sending the output of that to <tt>&lt;hackers@freebsd.org&gt;</tt>.
   See the man pages on <tt>tar(1)</tt> and <tt>uuencode(1)</tt> for more
   information on bundling files this way.

   If your change is of a potentially sensitive nature, e.g.
   you're unsure of copyright issues governing its further distribution
   or you're simply not ready to release it without a tighter review first,
   then you should send it to <tt>&lt;core@freebsd.org&gt;</tt> rather than
   <tt>&lt;hackers@freebsd.org&gt;</tt>.  The core mailing list
   reaches a much smaller group of people who do much of the
   day-to-day work on FreeBSD.  Note that this group is also
   <em>very busy</em> and so you should only send mail to them
   in cases where mailing to hackers is truly impractical.


<sect><heading>Contributions of new code</heading>

<p>In the case of a significant contribution of a large body
   work, or the addition of an important new feature to FreeBSD,
   it becomes almost always necessary to either send changes as
   uuencoded tar files or upload them to our ftp site <url
   url="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/incoming">.

   When working with large amounts of code, the touchy subject of
   copyrights also invariably comes up.  Acceptable copyrights
   for code included in FreeBSD are:

<enum>
	<item>The BSD copyright.  This copyright is most preferred
	    due to its ``no strings attached'' nature and general
	    attractiveness to commercial enterprises.  Far from
	    discouraging such commercial use, the FreeBSD Project
	    actively encourages such participation by commercial interests
	    who might eventually be inclined to invest something of their own
	    into FreeBSD.

	<item>The GNU Public License, or ``GPL''.  This license isn't quite
	    as popular with us due to the amount of extra effort demanded
	    of anyone using the code for commercial purposes, but given
	    the sheer quantity of GPL'd code we currently require (compiler,
	    assembler, text formatter, etc) it would be silly to refuse
	    additional contributions under this license.  Code under the GPL
	    also goes into a different part of the tree, that being
	    <tt>/sys/gnu</tt> or <tt>/usr/src/gnu</tt>, and is therefore
	    easily identifiable to anyone for whom the GPL presents a problem.
</enum>

<p>Contributions coming under any other type of copyright must be
   carefully reviewed before their inclusion into FreeBSD will
   be considered.  Contributions for which particularly restrictive
   commercial copyrights apply are generally rejected, though the
   authors are always encouraged to make such changes available
   through their own channels.

   To place a ``BSD-style'' copyright on your work, include the following
   text at the very beginning of every source code file you wish
   to protect, replacing the text between the `<tt>%%</tt>' with
   the appropriate information.

<sect><heading>Porting of software</heading>

<p>The porting of freely available software, while perhaps not as
gratifying as developing your own from scratch, is still a vital part
of FreeBSD's growth and of great usefulness to those who wouldn't
otherwise know where to turn for it.  All ported software is organized
into a carefully organized hierarchy know as ``the ports collection''.
The collection enables a new user to get a quick and complete overview
of what's available for FreeBSD in an easy-to-compile form.  It also
saves considerable space by not actually containing the the majority
of the sources being ported, but merely those differences required for
running under FreeBSD.  See <ref id="ports" name="The ports
collection"> for more information on using the ports collection and
<ref id="porting" name="Porting applications"> for guidelines on
creating new ports.  You may also send mail to
<tt>&lt;ports@freebsd.org&gt;</tt>.

Whichever way you decide to contribute, we hope you'll find it an
enjoyable and rewarding process.  Such contributions are also very
valuable to FreeBSD's continued progress, and as a free software
effort, the more we all put in the more we all get back out of it!
