	<heading>The online manual</heading>

	<p>The most comprehensive documentation on FreeBSD is in
	  the form of <em>man pages</em>.  Nearly every program
	  on the system comes with a short reference manual
	  explaining the basic operation and various argument.
	  These manuals can be view with the
	  <tt><bf>man</bf></tt> command.  Use of the
	  <tt><bf>man</bf></tt> command is simple:
	  <tscreen>
	    <tt><bf>man</bf> <it>command</it></tt>
	  </tscreen>
	  where <it>command</it> is the name of the command
	  you wish to find.  For example, to learn more about
	  <tt><bf>ls</bf></tt> command type:
	  <tscreen>
	    <tt><bf>man</bf> ls</tt>
	  </tscreen>

	<p>The online manual is divided up into numbered
	  sections:
	  <enum>
	    <item>User commands</item>
	    <item>System calls and error numbers</item>
	    <item>Functions in the C libraries</item>
	    <item>Device drivers</item>
	    <item>File formats</item>
	    <item>Games and other diversions</item>
	    <item>Miscellaneous information</item>
	    <item>System maintenance and operation commands</item>
	  </enum>
	  in some cases, the same topic may appear in more than
	  one section of the on-line manual.  For example, there
	  is a <tt><bf>chmod</bf></tt> user command and a
	  <tt><bf>chmod()</bf></tt> system call.  In this case,
	  you can tell the <tt><bf>man</bf></tt> command which
	  you want by specifying the section:
	  <tscreen>
	    <tt><bf>man</bf> 1 chmod</tt>
	  </tscreen>
	  which will display the manual page for the user command
	  <tt><bf>chmod</bf></tt>.

	<p>This is fine if you know the name of the command and
	  forgot how to use it, but what if you cannot recall the
	  command name?  You can use <tt><bf>man</bf></tt> to
	  search through the command <em>descriptions</em> by
	  using the <tt><bf>-k</bf></tt> switch:
	  <tscreen>
	    <tt><bf>man</bf> -k mail</tt>
	  </tscreen>
	  With this command you will be presented with a list of
	  commands that have the keyword `mail' in their
	  descriptions.

	<heading>GNU Info files</heading>

	<p>FreeBSD includes many applications and utilities
	  produced by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  In
	  addition to man pages, these programs come with more
	  extensive <em>info</em> files which can be viewed with
	  the <tt>info</tt> command or, if you installed
	  <tt>emacs</tt>, the info mode of <tt>emacs</tt>.
