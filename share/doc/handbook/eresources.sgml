  <heading>Resources on the Internet<label id="eresources"></heading>

  <p>The rapid pace of FreeBSD progress makes print media
    impractical as a means for following the latest
    developments.  Electronic resources are the best, if not the
    only way stay informed of the latest advances.  Also, since
    FreeBSD is a volunteer effort, the user community also serves
    as the technical support department and invariably,
    electronic mail and Usenet news are the most effective way of
    getting technical problems resolved.

    Below, the most important points of contact with the FreeBSD
    user community are outlined.  If you are aware of other
    resources not included, please send them to
    <tt>doc@freebsd.org</tt> so they may be included.

      <sect>
        <heading>Mailing lists<label id="eresources:mail"></heading>

<p>Though many of the FreeBSD development members read USENET, we cannot
always guarantee that we'll get to your questions in a timely fashion
(or at all) if you post them only to one of the comp.unix.bsd.*
groups.  By addressing your questions to the appropriate mailing list
you will reach both us and a concentrated FreeBSD audience, invariably
assuring a better (or at least faster) response.

There are list charters at the bottom of this document.  Please read
the list charter before joining a list.  We must strive to
keep the signal to noise ratio of the lists high, especially in
the technical lists.

Archives are kept for all of the mailing lists and can be searched
using the the <url url="http://www.freebsd.org/search.html"
name="FreeBSD World Wide Web server">.  The keyword searchable archive
offers an excellent way to find answers to frequently asked questions
and should be consulted before posting a question.

<sect1><heading>How to subscribe</heading>

<p>All mailing lists live on <tt>FreeBSD.ORG</tt>, so to post to a
list you simply mail to <em>listname</em><tt>@FreeBSD.ORG</tt>.  It
will then be redistributed to mailing list members throughout the
world.

To subscribe to a list, send mail to:
<tscreen><verb>
majordomo@FreeBSD.ORG
</verb></tscreen>
And include the keyword
<tscreen><verb>
subscribe <listname> [<optional address>]
</verb></tscreen>
In the body of your message.  For example, to subscribe yourself to
freebsd-announce, you'd do:
<tscreen><verb>
% mail majordomo@FreeBSD.ORG
subscribe freebsd-announce
^D
</verb></tscreen>
If you want to subscribe yourself under a different name, or submit a
subscription request for a local mailing list (note: this is more efficient
if you have several interested parties at one site, and highly appreciated by
us!), you would do something like:
<tscreen><verb>
% mail majordomo@FreeBSD.ORG
subscribe freebsd-announce local-announce@somesite.com
^D
</verb></tscreen>
Finally, it is also possible to unsubscribe yourself from a list, get a
list of other list members or see the list of mailing lists again by
sending other types of control messages to majordomo.  For a complete
list of available commands, do this:
<tscreen><verb>
% mail majordomo@FreeBSD.ORG
help
^D
</verb></tscreen>
Finally, we again request that you keep the technical mailing lists on
a technical track.  If you're only interested in the "high points",
then it's suggested that you join freebsd-announce, which will contain
only infrequent traffic.
