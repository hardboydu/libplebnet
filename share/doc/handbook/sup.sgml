<p><em>Contributed by &a.jkh; and &a.gclarkii;.</em> 

SUP is a network based software update tool developed at CMU.  The
purpose of this document is get the beginner up and running with sup.

<sect1><heading>Getting setup</heading>

<p>SUP gets the information it needs to run from a configuration file 
called a supfile.  There are different example supfiles provided
for different source releases of FreeBSD.  The 
<htmlurl url="file:/usr/share/examples/sup/standard-supfile"
name="/usr/share/examples/sup/standard-supfile"> file, for example,
contains sup information for the latest standard FreeBSD source
distributions - it tells sup what collections it will be updating
and/or installing and where they go.  Someone using this particular
supfile is said to be supping <ref id="current" name="-current">.
<p>For ports, please have a look at 
<htmlurl url="file:/usr/share/examples/sup/ports-supfile"
name="/usr/share/examples/sup/ports-supfile">.<p>
If you are interested in obtaining the
<htmlurl url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb" name="CVS"> files
that make up the source tree, refer to
<htmlurl url="file:/usr/share/examples/sup/cvs-supfile"
name="/usr/share/examples/sup/cvs-supfile">.<p>
If you would rather track changes to the -stable branch, refer to 
<htmlurl url="file:/usr/share/examples/sup/stable-supfile"
name="/usr/share/examples/sup/stable-supfile"> instead.

If you are inside the United States, you may also uncomment
the `secure' and `eBones' collection lines to grab the DES code.  
If you are outside the
U.S., you should NOT sup this code from sup.FreeBSD.ORG as this will
violate U.S. export restrictions.  Instead you should use the 
<htmlurl url="file:/usr/share/examples/sup/secure-supfile"
name="secure-supfile"> in the sup examples directory.  This will
connect you to the international sup site that contains a secure distribution.
Any distributions you do not wish to receive can be commented out
with a &num; at the beginning of the distribution line.

Please consult the file
<htmlurl url="file:/usr/share/examples/sup/README"
name="/usr/share/examples/sup/README">
for a list of alternate sup servers.  The default sup server (sup.FreeBSD.ORG)
listed in the above example files is currently overloaded and any traffic 
that can be transfered to a different host will help relieve some of 
the strain.

Once this is setup, you are ready to go.  To start sup type:
<verb>
	sup supfile
</verb>
If you wish to see what sup is doing "verbosely", give it the -v option,
like so:
<verb>
	sup -v supfile
</verb>
Thats all there is to it!  Remember that if you are running current,
which is what you will have if you sup with the standard-supfile, please 
join the &a.current .  You should also be sure to read 
<ref id="current" name="Staying current with FreeBSD">
for important information on just what we can and cannot do for you as
a -current user.    If you are using the stable-supfile, please
join the &a.stable and read
<ref id="stable" name="Staying stable with FreeBSD">.

<sect1><heading>Description of FreeBSD SUP distributions</heading>

<p>For the main FreeBSD distribution using the standard-supfile:
<verb>
src-base:	/usr/src/...		misc files at the top of /usr/src
src-bin:	/usr/src/bin		user and system binaries
src-secure:	/usr/src/secure		DES Sources (US/Canada ONLY) 
src-eBones:	/usr/src/eBones		Kerberos and DES (US/Canada ONLY)
src-etc:	/usr/src/etc		system files
src-games:	/usr/src/games		games
src-gnu:	/usr/src/gnu		sources under the GNU Public License
src-include:	/usr/src/include	include files
src-sys:	/usr/src/sys		kernel sources
src-lib:	/usr/src/lib		libraries
src-libexec:	/usr/src/libexec	system binaries
src-share:	/usr/src/share		various shared resources
src-sbin:	/usr/src/sbin		single user system binaries
src-usrbin:	/usr/src/usr.bin	user binaries
src-usrsbin:	/usr/src/usr.sbin	system binaries
</verb>

<p>For the international FreeBSD distribution using the secure-supfile:
<verb>
src-secure:	/usr/src/secure		DES Sources
src-eBones:	/usr/src/eBones		Kerberos and DES
</verb>

<p>And for the ports collection:
<verb>
ports-base:	  /usr/ports/...	misc files at the top of /usr/ports
ports-archivers:  /usr/ports/archivers	archiving tools
ports-audio:	  /usr/ports/audio	sound support
ports-benchmarks: /usr/ports/benchmarks	benchmarks
ports-cad:	  /usr/ports/cad	CAD tools
ports-comms:	  /usr/ports/comms	communication software
ports-databases:  /usr/ports/databases	databases
ports-devel:	  /usr/ports/devel	development utilities
ports-editors:    /usr/ports/editors	editors
ports-emulators:  /usr/ports/emulators	emulators for other OSes
ports-games:	  /usr/ports/games	games
ports-graphics:	  /usr/ports/graphics	various graphics utilities
ports-japanese:	  /usr/ports/japanese	Japanese software.
ports-lang:	  /usr/ports/lang	programming languages
ports-mail:	  /usr/ports/mail	mail software
ports-math:	  /usr/ports/math	numerical computation software
ports-misc:	  /usr/ports/misc	miscellaneous utilities
ports-net:	  /usr/ports/net	networking software
ports-news:	  /usr/ports/news	USENET news software
ports-plan9:	  /usr/ports/plan9	various programs from Plan9
ports-print:	  /usr/ports/print	printing software
ports-russian:    /usr/ports/russian    Russian software
ports-security:	  /usr/ports/security	``security'' utilities, for better or for worse
ports-shells:	  /usr/ports/shells	various UN*X shells
ports-sysutils:	  /usr/ports/sysutils	system utilities
ports-www:	  /usr/ports/www	software related to the world wide web
ports-x11:	  /usr/ports/x11	X11 software
</verb>

<p>If you want to keep updated on the original source of the ports,
you can also add this to your supfile.  But note that this collection
is <em>enormous</em>, and unless you are an ftp site mirroring the
entire FreeBSD tree (but cannot use ``mirror'' for some reason), you
(and us) are much better off not using sup to collect these:
<verb>
ports-distfiles: /usr/ports/distfiles	original tarballs
</verb>
