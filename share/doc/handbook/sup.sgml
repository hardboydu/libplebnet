<p><em>Contributed by &a.jkh; and &a.gclarkii;.</em> 

SUP is a network based software update tool developed at CMU.  The
purpose of this document is get the beginner up and running with sup.

<sect1><heading>Getting setup</heading>

<p>Starting with FreeBSD 2.1, sup is supplied as part of the base
system and no separate installation is required.

SUP gets the information it needs to run from a configuration file 
called a supfile. This file should be found in 
<tt>/usr/share/examples/sup/standard-supfile</tt> for the standard 
distributions.
This file tells sup what collections it will be updating
and/or installing and where they go.  This supfile will sup the current source
collection.  For ports please have a look at 
<tt>/usr/share/examples/sup/ports-supfile</tt>.  If you are interested 
in obtaining the cvs files that make up the source tree, refer to 
<tt>/usr/share/examples/sup/cvs-supfile</tt>.  If you would rather 
track changes to the -stable release, refer to 
<tt>/usr/share/examples/sup/stable-supfile</tt>
instead.

If you're inside the United States, you may also uncomment
the `secure' and `eBones' collection lines to grab the DES code.  
If you're outside the
U.S., you should NOT sup this code from sup.FreeBSD.ORG as this will
violate U.S. export restrictions.  Instead you should use the 
<tt>secure-supfile</tt> found within the above directory.  This will
connect you to the international sup site that contains a secure distribution.
Any distributions you do not wish to receive can be commented out
with a &num; at the beginning of the distribution line.

Please consult the file
<tt>/usr/share/examples/sup/README</tt>
for a list of alternate sup servers.  The default sup server (sup.FreeBSD.ORG)
listed in the above example files is currently overloaded and any traffic 
that can be transfered to a different host will help relieve some of 
the strain.

Once this is setup, you're ready to go.  To start sup type:
<verb>
	sup supfile
</verb>
If you wish to see what sup is doing "verbosely", give it the -v option,
like so:
<verb>
	sup -v supfile
</verb>
Thats all there is to it!  Remember that if you're running current,
which is what you will have if you sup with the standard-supfile, please 
join the freebsd-current mailing list.  You should also be sure to read 
<ref id="current" 
name="Staying current with FreeBSD">
for important information on just what we can and cannot do for you as
a -current user.    If you are using the stable-supfile, please
join the freebsd-stable mailing list.
