SUP is a network based software update tool developed at CMU.  The
purpose of this document is get the beginner up and running with sup.

<sect1><heading>Getting setup</heading>

<p>First off you will need to pick up the sup binaries.  The easiest
way of doing this is to grab the sup.tgz package from:
<verb>
        ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG:/pub/FreeBSD/packages/All/sup-2.0.tgz
</verb>
Install the sup package using pkg_add and add the following line to
your /etc/services file (if it doesn't already exist):
<verb>
        supfilesrv          871/tcp        # for SUP
</verb>

SUP gets the information it needs to run from a configuration file 
called a supfile. This file should be found in 
<tt>/usr/share/examples/sup/standard-supfile</tt> for the standard 
distributions.
This file tells sup what collections it will be updating
and/or installing and where they go.  This supfile will sup the current source
collection.  For ports please have a look at 
<tt>/usr/share/examples/sup/ports-supfile</tt>.
If you're inside the United States, you may also uncomment
the `secure' and `eBones' collection lines to grab the DES code.  
If you're outside the
U.S., you should NOT sup this code from sup.FreeBSD.ORG as this will
violate U.S. export restrictions.  Instead you should use the 
<tt>secure-supfile</tt> found within the above directory.  This will
connect you to the international sup site that contains a secure distribution.
Any distributions you do not wish to receive can be commented out
with a &num; at the beginning of the distribution line.

Once this is setup, you're ready to go.  To start sup type:
<verb>
	sup supfile
</verb>
If you wish to see what sup is doing "verbosely", give it the -v option,
like so:
<verb>
	sup -v supfile
</verb>
Thats all there is to it!  Remember that if you're running current,
which is what you will have if you sup, please join the freebsd-current
mailing list.  You should also be sure to read <ref id="current" 
name="Staying current with FreeBSD">
for important information on just what we can and cannot do for you as
a -current user.
