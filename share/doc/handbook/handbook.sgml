      name="a brief history of FreeBSD">.  To see a description of the
      latest release, read <ref id="relnotes"

    <p>If your connection to the Internet is through a modem, or
    you wish to provide other people with dialup connections to
    the Internet using FreeBSD, you have the option of using PPP
    or SLIP.  Furthermore, two varieties of PPP are provided:
    <em>user</em> (sometimes referred to as iijppp) and
    <em>kernel</em>.  The procedures for configuring both types
    of PPP, and for setting up SLIP are described in this
    chapter.

    <chapt><heading>The Cutting Edge: FreeBSD-current and FreeBSD-stable</>
    <p>FreeBSD is under constant development between releases.  For
    people who want to be on the cutting edge, there are several
    easy mechanisms for keeping your system in sync with the latest
    developments.  Be warned: the cutting edge is not for everyone!
    This chapter will help you decide if you want to track the development
    system, or stick with one of the released versions.</p>
