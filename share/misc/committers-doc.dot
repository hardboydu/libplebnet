# ????/??/?? is the date when the commit bit was obtained, usually the one you
# can find looking at CVS logs for the access (or avail) file under CVSROOT.

# For returned commit bits, the node definition will follow this example:

#   foo [label="Foo Bar\nfoo@FreeBSD.org\n????/??/??\n????/??/??"]
#
# The first date is the same as for an active committer, the second date is
# the date when the commit bit has been returned. Again, check CVS logs.
