.Sh NAME
.Nm ffs
.Nd Berkeley fast file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd options FFS
.Cd options SOFTUPDATES
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Berkeley fast file system
provides facilities to store file system data onto a disk device.
.Nm FFS
has been optimized over the years
for speed and reliability
and is the basis for the
.Xr ufs 4
file system.
.Pp
The
.Dv SOFTUPDATES
option is used to enable soft updates.
The soft updates feature tracks writes to the disk
and enforces metadata update dependancies
(e.g. updating free block maps)
to ensure that the file system remains consistent.
To enable this feature,
add the following to your kernel configuration file:
.Pp
.Dl Cd options SOFTUPDATES
.Pp
To enable soft updates on an
.Em unmounted
file system, use the following command:
.Pp
.Dl Ic tunefs -n enable Sy /foo
.Pp
.Dq Sy foo
can be either a mount point listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab
(e.g.
.Pa /usr ) ,
or a disk device
(e.g.
.Pa /dev/da0s1a ) .
.Pp
The following
.Xr sysctl 8
MIBs are defined for use with
.Nm FFS :
.Bl -hang -width "vfs.ffs.doreallocblk" 
.It Em vfs.ffs.doasyncfree
Asynchronously write out modified inode and indirect blocks
upon reallocating file system blocks to be contiguous.
(Default: 1.)
.It Em vfs.ffs.doreallocblks
Enable support for the rearrangement of blocks
to be contiguous.
(Default: 1.)
