.Nm ports
.Nd contributed applications
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm FreeBSD Ports Collection
offers a simple way for users and
administrators to install applications.
Each 
.Ar port
listed here contains any patches necessary to make the original
application source code compile and run on BSD. Installing an
application is as simple as downloading the port, unpacking it and typing
make in the port directory. The Makefile automatically fetches the
application source code, either from a local disk or via ftp, unpacks it
on your system, applies the patches, and compiles. If all goes well,
simply type
.Ar make install
to install the application.
