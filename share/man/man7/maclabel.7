.Sh NAME
.Nm maclabel
.Nd Mandatory Access Control label format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
If Mandatory Access Control, or
.Dq MAC ,
is enabled in your kernel,
then in addition to the traditional credentials,
each subject
(typically a user or a socket)
and object
(file system object, socket, etc)
is given a
.Em MAC label .
The MAC label specifies the necessary subject-specific or
object-specific information necessary for a MAC security policy
.\" .Xr ( mac 9 )
to enforce access control on the subject/object.
.Pp
The format for a MAC label is defined as follows:
.Dl Sy policy1 Ns No / Ns Sy qualifier1 , Ns Sy policy2 Ns No / Ns Sy qualifier2 , Ns ...
.Pp
A MAC label consists of a policy name,
followed by a forward slash,
followed by the subject or object's qualifier,
optionally followed by a comma and one or more additional policy labels.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl Li "biba/low(low-low)"
.Dl Li "biba/high(low-high),mls/equal(equal-equal),partition/0"
