.Sh NAME
.Nm dev_clone ,
.Nm drain_dev_clone_events
.Nd eventhandler for name-based device cloning in devfs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/conf.h
.Ft void
.Fn clone_handler "void *arg" "struct ucred *cr" "char *name" "int namelen" "struct cdev **dev"
.Bd -literal
EVENTHANDLER_REGISTER(dev_clone, clone_handler, arg, priority);
.Ed
.Ft void
.Fn drain_dev_clone_events
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Device driver may register a listener that will be notified each time
name lookup on the
.Xr devfs
mount point fails to find the vnode.
Listener shall be registered for the
.Va dev_clone
event.
When called, it is supplied with the first argument
.Va arg
that was specified at handler registration time,
appropriate credentials
.Va cr ,
.Va name
of the length
.Va namelen
that was looked for.
If handler decides that the name is appropriate and want to create device
that will be associated with the name, it should return it to the devfs
in the
.Va dev .
.Pp
The
.Fn drain_dev_clone_events
function is a barrier.
It is guaranteed that all calls to eventhandlers for dev_clone that were
started before
.Fn drain_dev_clone_events
call, are finished before it returns control.
