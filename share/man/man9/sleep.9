.Dt SLEEP 9
.Sh NAME
.Nm sleep
.Nd wait for events
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/systm.h>
.Fd #include <sys/proc.h>
.Fd #include <sys/errno.h>
.Ft int
.Fn tsleep "void *ident" "int priority" "char *wmesg" "int timo"
.Ft void
.Fn wakeup "void *ident"
.Ft int
.Fn sleep "void *ident" "int priority"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The functions
.Fn tsleep
and
.Fn wakeup
handle event-based process blocking.  If a process must wait for an
external event, it is put on sleep by
.Nm tsleep .
The parameter
.Ar ident
is an arbitrary address that uniquely identifies the event on which
the process is being asleep.  All process sleeping on a single
.Ar ident
are woken up later by
.Nm wakeup ,
often called from inside an interrupt routine, to indicate that the
resource the process was blocking on is available now.
.Pp
The parameter
.Ar wmesg
is a string describing the sleep condition for tools like
.Xr ps 1 .
Due to the limited space of those programs to display arbitrary strings,
this message should not be longer than 6 characters.
.Pp
.Nm Tsleep
is the general sleep call.  Suspends the current process until a wakeup is
performed on the specified identifier.  The process will then be made
runnable with the specified
.Ar priority .
Sleeps at most
.Ar timo
\&/ hz seconds (0 means no timeout).  If
.Ar pri
includes the
.Ql PCATCH
flag, signals are checked before and after sleeping, else signals are
not checked.  Returns 0 if awakened,
.Ql EWOULDBLOCK
if the timeout expires.  If
.Ql PCATCH
is set and a signal needs to be delivered,
.Ql ERESTART
is returned if the current system call should be restarted if
possible, and
.Ql EINTR
is returned if the system call should be interrupted by the signal
.Pq return Ql EINTR .
.Pp
.Nm Sleep
is the traditional form.  It doesn't let you specifiy a timeout nor a
.Ar wmesg ,
hence its use is deprecated.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
See above.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ps 1
.Sh HISTORY
The sleep/wakeup process synchronisation mechanism is very old.  It
appeared in a very early version of Unix.
.Pp
.Nm Tsleep
appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
