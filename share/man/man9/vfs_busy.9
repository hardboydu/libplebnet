.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vfs_busy
.Nd "Marks a mount point as busy."
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/mount.h>
.Ft int
.Fn vfs_busy "struct mount *mp" "int flags" "struct mtx *interlkp" "struct proc *p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function marks a mount point as busy.  The purpose of this
function is to synchronize access to a mount point.  It also
delays unmounting by sleeping on mp if the MNTK_UNMOUNT flag
is set in mp->mnt_kern_flag and the LK_NOWAIT flag is NOT set.
.Pp
Its arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width interlkp
.It Ar mp
The mount point to busy.
.It Ar flags
Flags controlling the operation of
.Nm
.
.Pp
LK_NOWAIT - do not sleep if MNTK_UNMOUNT is set.
.It Ar interlkp
The interlock mutex for mp->mount_lock.  If there is any chance
the mount point is being unmounted and LK_NOWAIT is not set then
interlock must be valid locked mutex.
.It Ar p
The process responsible for this call.
.El
.Sh LOCKS
If interlkp is a valid pointer it must be locked on entry,
and it will not be unlocked even on error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
A 0 value is returned on success.  If the mount point is being
unmounted ENOENT will always be returned.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag
.It Bq ENOENT
The mount point is being unmounted (MNTK_UNMOUNT is set).
