.Sh DESCRIPTION
Access control lists, or ACLs, allow fine-grained specification of rights
for vnodes representing files and directories.  However, as there are a
plethora of file systems with differing ACL semantics, the vnode interface
is aware only of the syntax of ACLs, relying on the underlying file system
to implement the details.  Depending on the underlying file system, each
file or directory may have zero or more ACLs associated with it, named using
the
.Fa type
field of the appropriate vnode ACL calls,
.Xr VOP_ACLCHECK 9 ,
.Xr VOP_GETACL 9 ,
and
.Xr VOP_SETACL 9 .
.Pp
Currently, each ACL is represented in-kernel by a fixed-size acl structure.
An ACL is constructed from a fixed size array of ACL entries, each of which
consists of a set of permissions, principal namespace, and principal
identifier.  Zero or more of these entries may be "defined", depending on
the value of the associated acl_cnt field.
