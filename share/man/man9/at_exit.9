.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/systm.h>

.Ft typedef void \*(lp*exitlist_fn\*(rp \*(lpstruct proc *\*(rp;


.Ft int
.Fn at_exit "exitlist_fn func"

The

facility allows a kernel module to ensure that it is notified
at any process exit.
The function
.Ar func
is called with the a pointer to the exiting process's proc structure.
.Pp
If the requirement for notification is removed, then the function 
.Nm rm_at_exit
must be called with the exact
.Ar func
argument as the corresponding call to
.Fn at_exit .
.Pp
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm at_exit
returns an errno, 0 meaning success. 
.Nm rm_at_exit
returns the number of items removed (should be 0 or 1).
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr exit 2
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm at_exit
appeared in FreeBSD 2.2
.Sh BUGS
Since the exit queue is not sorted
and items are added to the head, order of execution 
is reversed to that of insertion.
