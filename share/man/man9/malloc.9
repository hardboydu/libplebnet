.Dt MALLOC 9
.Os FreeBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm malloc ,
.Nm MALLOC ,
.Nm free ,
.Nm FREE
.Nd kernel memory management routines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/malloc.h>
.Ft void *
.Fn malloc "unsigned long size" "struct malloc_type *type" "int flags"
.Fn MALLOC "space" "cast" "unsigned long size" "struct malloc_type  *type" "int flags"
.Ft void
.Fn free "void *addr" "struct malloc_type *type"
.Fn FREE "void *addr" "struct malloc_type *type"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn malloc
function allocates uninitialized memory in kernel address space for an
object whose size is specified by
.Fa size .
.Fn free
releases memory at address
.Fa addr
that was previously allocated by
.Fn malloc
for re-use.
The
.Fn MALLOC
macro variant is functionally equivalent to
.Bd -literal -offset indent
(space) = (cast)malloc((u_long)(size), type, flags)
.Ed
.Pp
and the
.Fn FREE
macro variant is equivalent to
.Bd -literal -offset indent
free((addr), type)
.Ed
.Pp
Unlike its standard C library counterpart
.Pq Xr malloc 3 ,
the kernel version takes two more arguments.  The
.Fa flags
argument further qualifies
.Fn malloc No Ns 's
operational characteristics as follows:
.Bl -tag -offset indent
.It Dv M_NOWAIT
Causes
.Fn malloc
to return
.Dv NULL
if the request cannot be immediately fulfilled due to resource shortage.
Otherwise,
.Fn malloc
may call sleep to wait for resources to be released by other processes.
If this flag is not set,
.Fn malloc
will never return
.Dv NULL .
Note that
.Dv M_WAITOK
is conveniently defined to be 0, and hence may be or'ed into the
.Fa flags
argument to indicate that it's Ok to wait for resources.
.El
.Pp
Currently, only one flag is defined.
.Pp
The
.Fa type
argument is used to perform statistics on memory usage, and for
basic sanity checks.
The statistics can be examined by
.Sq vmstat -m .
.Pp
A
.Fa type
is defined using the
.Va malloc_type_t
typedef like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/* sys/something/foo_extern.h */

extern malloc_type_t M_FOOBUF;

/* sys/something/foo_main.c */

malloc_type_t M_FOOBUF = {
	"Foo Buffers",
	"Buffers for foo data in transit to the InfImpDrive"
};

/* sys/something/foo_subr.c */

...
MALLOC(buf, struct foo_buf *, sizeof *buf, M_FOOBUF, M_NOWAIT);

.Be
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn malloc
returns a kernel virtual address that is suitably aligned for storage of
any type of object.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr vmstat 8
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
A kernel compiled with the
.Dv DIAGNOSTIC
configuration option attempts to detect detect memory corruption caused by
such things as writing outside the allocated area and imbalanced calls to the
.Fn malloc
and
.Fn free
functions. Failing consistency checks will cause a panic or a system console
message:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact

.Dq malloc: bogus type
