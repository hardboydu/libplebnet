.Sh NAME
.\" .Cd options MAC_BSDEXTENDED
.Nm mac_bsdextended
.Nd mandatory rules regarding users and system objects
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Li kldload mac_bsdextended
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides an interface for the system administrator
to impose mandatory rules regarding users and some system objects.
Rules are uploaded to the module
(typically using
.Xr libugidfw 3 )
where they are stored internally
and used to determine whether to allow or deny specific accesses
(see
.Xr ugidfw 8 ) .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
While the traditional
.Xr mac 9
entry points are implemented,
policy labels are not used;
instead, access control decisions are made by iterating through the internal
list of rules until a rule
which denies the particular access
is found,
or the end of the list is reached.
