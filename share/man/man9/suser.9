.Sh NAME
.Nm suser
.Nd check if we are superuser and note
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/ucred.h>
.Ft int
.Fn suser "struct ucred *cred, u_short *acflag"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function checks if the credentials given include superuser powers.
.Pp
The
.Nm
routine notes the fact that superuser powers have been used in the 
word pointed to by the second argument which should be a pointer to
the p_acflags word of the proc structure. If the second argument is NULL
then the usage is not noted.  Because part of it's function is to notice
whether super powers have been used, 
.Nm 
should be called after other permission possibilities have been exhausted.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
function returns 0 if the user has super powers and EPERM otherwise.
This is the
.Em reverse logic
of some other implementations of
.Nm
in which a TRUE response indicates Super powers.
