.Sh NAME
.Nm VOP_ACCESS
.Nd "check access permissions of a file or Unix domain socket"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/vnode.h
.Ft int
.Fn VOP_ACCESS "struct vnode *vp" "accmode_t accmode" "struct ucred *cred" "struct thread *td"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This entry point checks the access permissions of the file against the
given credentials.
.Pp
Its arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width accmode
.It Fa vp
The vnode of the file to check.
.It Fa accmode
The type of access required.
.It Fa cred
The user credentials to check.
.It Fa td
The thread which is checking.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa accmode
is a mask which can contain flags described in <sys/vnode.h>, e.g.
.Dv VREAD ,
.Dv VWRITE
or
.Dv VEXEC .
.Sh LOCKS
The vnode will be locked on entry and should remain locked on return.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the file is accessible in the specified way, then zero is returned,
otherwise an appropriate error code is returned.
.Sh PSEUDOCODE
.Bd -literal
int

{
    int error;

    /*
     * Disallow write attempts on read-only file systems;
     * unless the file is a socket, fifo, or a block or
     * character device resident on the filesystem.

.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EPERM
