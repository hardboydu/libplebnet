.Sh NAME
.Nm resource_query_string
.Nd queries the hints database for matches
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/bus.h>
.Ft int
.Fn resource_query_string "int num" "const char *field" "const char *what"
.Pp
.Ft char *
.Fn resource_query_name "int num"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
Queries strings in the hints database that match the
.Fa what
field.
.Pp
.Fn resouce_query_string 
is called to see enumerate all possible strings.
It returns the next one after num that is available,
or -1 if nothing further is available.
.Fn resource_query_name 
is passed the return of 
.Fn resource_query_string 
and returns its value.
.Bl -item
.It
.Fa num
Index to get.
Set initially to -1 for the first call,
and to the previous return value of
.Fn resource_query_string
on subsequent calls.
.It
.Fa field
is the name of the field.
.Pp
.Fa what
is the string to look for.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
-1 on failure, otherwise it is the index to pass
resource_query_name().
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example will return all the hints that say they are
at gerbil0.
An example hint would be:
.Bd -literal
hint.habitat.0.at="gerbil0"
hint.ewheel.0.at="gerbil0"
hint.fred.0.at="nexus"
.Ed
.Pp
The following code
.Bd -literal
	int i = -1;
	while ((i = resource_query_string(i, "at", "gerbil0")) != -1) {
		printf("Found %s%d at gerbil0\n", resource_query_name(i),
		    resource_query_unit(i));
	}
.Ed
would produce two lines:
.Bd -literal
Found habitat0 at gerbil0
Found ewheel0 at gerbil0
