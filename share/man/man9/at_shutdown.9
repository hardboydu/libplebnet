.Dt AT_SHUTDOWN 9
.Sh NAME
.Nm at_shutdown ,
.Nm rm_at_shutdown
.Nd ask that a function be run at shutdown.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/systm.h>
.Fd #include <sys/reboot.h>
.Ft typedef void \*(lp*bootlist_fn\*(rp\*(lpint howto, void *arg\*(rp

.Ft int
.Fn at_shutdown "bootlist_fn func" "void *arg" "int when"
.Ft int
.Fn rm_at_shutdown "bootlist_fn func" "void *arg"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm at_shutdown
facility allows a kernel module to ensure that it is notified
at system shutdown.
The function
.Fa func
is called with the flags indicating boot type, and the opaque argument
.Fa arg
when the system is shut down.
.Pp
If the requirement for notification is removed, then the function 
.Fn rm_at_shutdown
must be called with the exact
.Fa func
and
.Fa arg
arguments as the corresponding call to
.Fn at_shutdown .
There are three shutdown queues, the first is run before the final filesystems
sync, the second is run after the sync, before the system disables all
interrupts, and the last queue is run with interrupts disabled just before
the system is reset or halted
.
The last argument to 
.Fa at_shutdown
should be one of 
.Dv SHUTDOWN_PRE_SYNC
or
.Dv SHUTDOWN_POST_SYNC
or
.Dv SHUTDOWN_FINAL
to specify which queue should be used.
.Fn rm_at_shutdown
will remove entries from any queue.
.Pp
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn at_shutdown
returns an error code, 0 meaning success. 
.Fn rm_at_shutdown
returns the number of items removed (should be 0 or 1).
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr reboot 2 ,
.Xr boot 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn at_shutdown
and
.Fn rm_shutdown
functions
appeared in
.Fx 2.2 .
.Sh BUGS
Since the shutdown queue is not sorted
and items are added to the head, order of execution 
is reversed to that of insertion.
.Sh AUTHORS
The function was written by
.An Julian Elischer Aq julian@FreeBSD.org .
