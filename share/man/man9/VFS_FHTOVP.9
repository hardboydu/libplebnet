.Sh NAME
.Nm VFS_FHTOVP
.Nd turn an NFS filehandle into a vnode
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/mount.h>
.Fd #include <sys/vnode.h>
.Ft int
.Fn VFS_FHTOVP "struct mount *mp" "struct fid *fhp" "struct mbuf  *nam" "struct vnode **vpp" "int *exflagsp" "struct ucred **credanonp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is used by the NFS server to turn an NFS filehandle into a vnode.
.Pp
Its arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width credanonp
.It Ar mp
The filesystem.
.It Ar fhp
The filehandle to convert.
.It Ar nam
An mbuf containing the network address of the client.
.It Ar vpp
Return parameter for the new locked vnode.
.It Ar exflagsp
Return parameter for the export flags for this client.
.It Ar credanonp
Return parameter for the anonymous credentials for this client.
.El
.Pp
The contents of the filehandle are defined by the filesystem and are
not examined by any other part of the system.  It should contain
enough information to uniquely identify a file within the filesystem
as well as noticing when a file has been removed and the filesystem
resources have been reused for a new file.  For instance, UFS
filesystem stores the inode number and inode generation counter in its
filehandle.
.Pp
The filesystem should call
.Xr vfs_export_lookup 9
with the address of an appropriate
.Dv netexport 
structure and the address of the client,
.Fa nam ,
to verify that the client can access this filesystem.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The locked vnode for the file will be returned in
.Fa *vpp .
The export flags and anonymous credentials specific to the client
(returned by
.Xr vfs_export_lookup 9 )
will be returned in
.Fa *exflagsp
and
.Fa *credanonp .
