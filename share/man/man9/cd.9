.Nm cd
.Nd device driver for SCSI subsystem
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The cd device driver provies the 
.Tn SCSI
subsystem a way to handle type 5
.Pq Dv T_READONLY
media.  Some drives don't behave as the driver expects.  See the section
QUIRKS for info on possible flags.
.Sh QUIRKS
Each
.Tn CD-ROM
device can have different interpretations of the
.Tn SCSI
spec.  This can lead to drives requiring special handling in the driver.  The
following is a list of quirks that the driver recognize.  See
.Xr scsiconf 9
for more information on how to add quirk entries.
.Bl -tag -width CD_Q_BCD_TRACKS
.It Dv CD_Q_NO_TOUCH
This flag tell the driver not to probe the drive at attach time to see if
there is a disk in the drive and find out what size it is.
.ig xx
.It Dv CD_Q_BCD_TRACKS
This flag is for broken drives that return the track numbers in packed BCD
encoding instead of straight decimal.  If the drive seems to skip tracks
.Pq usually tracks 10-15 are skipped
then you have a drive that is in need of this flag.
