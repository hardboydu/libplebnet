.Sh NAME
.Nm VFS_CHECKEXP
.Nd check if vnode is exported to a client
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/mount.h>
.Fd #include <sys/vnode.h>
.Ft int
.Fn VFS_CHECKEXP "struct mount *mp" "struct mbuf  *nam" "int *exflagsp" "struct ucred **credanonp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is used by the NFS server to check if a vnode is exported to a client.
.Pp
Its arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width credanonp
.It Ar mp
The mount point to be checked.
.It Ar nam
An mbuf containing the network address of the client.
.It Ar exflagsp
Return parameter for the export flags for this client.
.It Ar credanonp
Return parameter for the anonymous credentials for this client.
.El
.Pp
This should be called on a file system's mount structure to determine if it 
is exported to a client whos address is contained in 
.Fa nam .
.Pp
It is generally called before
.Xr VFS_FHTOVP 9
to validate that a client has access to the filesystem.
.Pp
The filesystem should call
.Xr vfs_export_lookup 9
with the address of an appropriate
.Dv netexport 
structure and the address of the client,
.Fa nam ,
to verify that the client can access this filesystem.
.Pp
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The export flags and anonymous credentials specific to the client
will be returned in
.Fa *exflagsp
and
.Fa *credanonp .
