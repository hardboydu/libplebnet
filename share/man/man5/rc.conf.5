.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.conf
.Nd local configuration information.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm rc.conf
contains descriptive information about the local host name, configuration
details for any potential network interfaces and which services should be
started up at system initial boot time.  In new installations, the
.Nm rc.conf
file is generally initialized by the system installation utility:
.Pa /stand/sysinstall .
.Pp
It is the duty of the system administrator to properly maintain this file
as changes occur on the local host.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/rc.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/rc.conf
.El
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The purpose of
.Nm
is not to run commands or perform system startup actions
directly.  Instead, it is included by the
various generic startup scripts in
.Pa /etc
which conditionalize their
internal actions according to the settings found there.
.Pp
The following list provides a name and short description for each
variable you can set in the
.Nm
file:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar swapfile
(str) If set to
.Ar NO
then no swapfile is installed, otherwise the value is used as the full
pathname to a file to use for additional swap space.
.It Ar apm_enable
(bool) If set to
.Ar YES ,
enable support for Automatic Power Management with
the
.Xr apm 8
command.
.It Ar pccard_enable
(bool) If set to
.Ar YES ,
enable PCCARD support at boot time.
.It Ar pccard_mem
(str) Set to PCCARD controller memory address or
.Ar DEFAULT
for the default value.
.It Ar pccard_ifconfig
(str) List of ethernet devices (e.g.
.Ar "ed0 ed1 ep0 ..." )
which should be dynamically ifconfig'd on insertion or boot.
.It Ar local_startup
(str) List of directories to search for startup script files.
.It Ar local_periodic
(str) List of directories to search for periodic scripts (3.0 only).
.It Ar hostname
(str) The Fully Qualified Domain Name of your host on the network.
This should almost certainly be set to something meaningful, even if
you've no network connected.
.It Ar nisdomainname
(str) The NIS domainname of your host, or
.Ar NO
if you're not running NIS.
.It Ar firewall_enable
(bool) Set to
.Ar NO
if you don't want have firewall rules loaded at startup, or 
.Ar YES 
if you do.
If set to
.Ar YES ,
and the kernel was not built with IPFIREWALL, the ipfw
kernel module will be loaded.
.It Ar firewall_type
(str) Names the firewall type from the selection in 
.Pa /etc/rc.firewall ,
or the file which contains the local firewall ruleset.  Valid selections
from 
.Pa /etc/rc.firewall ,
are ``open'' - unrestricted IP access; ``closed'' - all IP services disabled,
except via lo0; ``client'' - basic protection for a workstation; ``simple'' -
basic protection for a LAN.  If a filename is specified, the full path 
must be given.
.It Ar firewall_quiet
(bool) Set to 
.Ar YES
to disable the display of ipfw rules on the console during boot.
.It Ar tcp_extensions
(bool) Set to
.Ar YES
by default, this enables certain TCP options as described by
Internet RFCs 1323 and 1644.  If you have problems with connections
randomly hanging or other weird behavior of such nature, you might
try setting this to
.Ar NO
and seeing if that helps.  Some hardware/software out there is known
to be broken with respect to these options.
.It Ar network_interfaces
(str) Set to the list of network interfaces to configure on this host.
For example, if you had a loopback device (standard) and an SMC Elite
Ultra NIC, you might have this set to
.Qq Ar "lo0 ed0"
for the two interfaces.  An 
.No ifconfig_ Ns Em interface
variable is also assumed to exist for each value of 
.Em interface .
It is also possible to add IP alias entries here in cases where you
want a single interface to have multiple IP addresses registered against
it.
Assuming that the interface in question was ed0, it might look
something like this:
.Bd -literal
ifconfig_ed0_alias0="inet 127.0.0.253 netmask 0xffffffff" 
ifconfig_ed0_alias1="inet 127.0.0.254 netmask 0xffffffff"

.Ed
And so on.  For each ifconfig_<interface>_alias<n> entry that is
found, its contents are passed to
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
Execution stops at the first unsuccessful access, so if you
had something like:
.Bd -literal
ifconfig_ed0_alias0="inet 127.0.0.251 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias1="inet 127.0.0.252 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias2="inet 127.0.0.253 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias4="inet 127.0.0.254 netmask 0xffffffff"

.Ed
Then note that alias4 would \fBnot\fR be added since the search would
stop with the missing alias3 entry.

(bool) If set to

run the
.Xr syslogd 8
daemon.
.It Ar syslogd_flags
(str) if syslogd_enable is set to

.Pp
It should also be noted that while this is enabled, any
