.Dt RC.CONF 5
.Os FreeBSD 2.2.2
.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.conf
.Nd system configuration information.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm rc.conf
contains descriptive information about the local host name, configuration
details for any potential network interfaces and which services should be
started up at system initial boot time.  In new installations, the
.Nm rc.conf
file is generally initialized by the system installation utility:
.Pa /stand/sysinstall .
.Pp
The purpose of
.Nm rc.conf
is not to run commands or perform system startup actions
directly.  Instead, it is included by the
various generic startup scripts in
.Pa /etc
which conditionalize their
internal actions according to the settings found there.
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file is included from the file
.Pa /etc/defaults/rc.conf ,
which specifies the default settings for all the available options. Options
need only be specified in 
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
when the system administrator wishes to override these defaults. The file
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local
is used to override settings in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
for historical reasons. See the
.Dq rc_conf_files
option below.
.Pp
The following list provides a name and short description for each
variable you can set in the
.Nm
file:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar swapfile
(str) If set to
.Ar NO
then no swapfile is installed, otherwise the value is used as the full
pathname to a file to use for additional swap space.

enable PCCARD support at boot time.
.It Ar pccard_mem
(str) Set to PCCARD controller memory address or
.Ar DEFAULT
for the default value.
.It Ar pccard_ifconfig
(str) List of arguments to be passed to ifconfig(8) at boot time or on
insertion of of the card (e.g. "inet 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0"
for a fixed address or "DHCP" for a DHCP client).
.It Ar pccard_conf
(str) Path to the configuration file for the
.Xr pccardd 8
daemon (e.g. 
.Ar /etc/pccard.conf.sample ) .
.It Ar pccardd_flags
(str) If 
.Ar pccard_enable 
is set to 
.Ar YES , 
these are the flags to pass to the 
.Xr pccardd 8
daemon.
.It Ar local_startup
(str) List of directories to search for startup script files.
.It Ar local_periodic
(str) List of directories to search for periodic scripts (3.0 only).
.It Ar hostname
(str) The Fully Qualified Domain Name of your host on the network.
This should almost certainly be set to something meaningful, even if
you've no network connected.
.It Ar nisdomainname
(str) The NIS domainname of your host, or
.Ar NO
if you're not running NIS.
.It Ar dhcp_program
(str) Path to the DHCP client progam (/sbin/dhclient, the ISC DHCP client,
is the default).
.It Ar dhcp_flags
(str) Additional flags to pass to the DHCP client program.
.It Ar firewall_enable
(bool) Set to
.Ar NO
if you don't want have firewall rules loaded at startup, or 
.Ar YES 
if you do.
If set to
.Ar YES ,
and the kernel was not built with IPFIREWALL, the ipfw
kernel module will be loaded.
.It Ar firewall_type
(str) Names the firewall type from the selection in 
.Pa /etc/rc.firewall ,
or the file which contains the local firewall ruleset.  Valid selections
from 
.Pa /etc/rc.firewall ,
are ``open'' - unrestricted IP access; ``closed'' - all IP services disabled,
except via lo0; ``client'' - basic protection for a workstation; ``simple'' -
basic protection for a LAN.  If a filename is specified, the full path 
must be given.
.It Ar firewall_quiet
(bool) Set to 
.Ar YES
to disable the display of ipfw rules on the console during boot.
.It Ar natd_program
(str) path to
.Xr natd 8 .
.It Ar natd_enable
(bool) Set to
.Ar YES
to enable natd.
.Ar Firewall_enable
must also be set to
.Ar YES ,
and

sockets must be enabled in your kernel.
.It Ar natd_interface
This is the name of the public interface on which natd should run.  It
is mandatory if
.Ar natd_enable
is set to
.Ar YES .
The interface may be given as an interface name or as an IP address.
.It Ar natd_flags
Additional natd flags should be placed here.  The
.Fl n
or
.Fl a
flag is automatically added with the above
.Ar natd_interface
as an argument.
.It Ar tcp_extensions
(bool) Set to
.Ar NO
by default. Setting this to YES enables certain TCP options as described by
Internet RFCs 1323 and 1644.  If you have problems with connections
randomly hanging or other weird behavior of such nature, you might
try setting this back to
.Ar NO
and seeing if that helps.  Some hardware/software out there is known
to be broken with respect to these options.
.It Ar log_in_vain
(bool) Set to
.Ar NO
by default.
Setting to YES will enable logging of connection attempts to ports that
have no listening socket on them.
.It Ar network_interfaces
(str) Set to the list of network interfaces to configure on this host.
For example, if you had a loopback device (standard) and an SMC Elite
Ultra NIC, you might have this set to
.Qq Ar "lo0 ed0"
for the two interfaces.  An 
.No ifconfig_ Ns Em interface
variable is also assumed to exist for each value of 
.Em interface .
It is also possible to add IP alias entries here in cases where you
want a single interface to have multiple IP addresses registered against
it.
Assuming that the interface in question was ed0, it might look
something like this:
.Bd -literal
ifconfig_ed0_alias0="inet 127.0.0.253 netmask 0xffffffff" 
ifconfig_ed0_alias1="inet 127.0.0.254 netmask 0xffffffff"

.Ed
And so on.  For each ifconfig_<interface>_alias<n> entry that is
found, its contents are passed to
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
Execution stops at the first unsuccessful access, so if you
had something like:
.Bd -literal
ifconfig_ed0_alias0="inet 127.0.0.251 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias1="inet 127.0.0.252 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias2="inet 127.0.0.253 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias4="inet 127.0.0.254 netmask 0xffffffff"

.Ed
Then note that alias4 would \fBnot\fR be added since the search would
stop with the missing alias3 entry.

.Xr ppp 8
daemon.

Even if your mouse is not in the above list, it may be compatible
with one in the list. Refer to the man page for
.Xr moused 8
for compatibility information.
.Pp
It should also be noted that while this is enabled, any
other client of the mouse (such as an X server) should access
the mouse through the virtual mouse device:
.Pa /dev/sysmouse
and configure it as a sysmouse type mouse, since all
mouse data is converted to this single canonical format when
using
.Xr moused 8 .
If the client program does not support the sysmouse type, 
specify the mousesystems type. It is the second prefered type.
.It Ar moused_port
(str) If
.Ar moused_enable
is set to
.Ar YES ,
this is the actual port the mouse is on.
It might be
.Pa /dev/cuaa0
for a COM1 serial mouse,
.Pa /dev/psm0
for a PS/2 mouse or
.Pa /dev/mse0
for a bus mouse, for example.
.It Ar moused_flags
(str) If
.Ar moused_type
is set, these are the additional flags to pass to the
.Xr moused 8
daemon.
.It Ar cron_enable
(bool) If set to
.Ar YES
then run the
.Xr cron 8
daemon at system boot time.
.It Ar lpd_program
(str) path to
.Xr lpd 8
(default
.Pa /usr/sbin/lpd ) .
.It Ar lpd_enable
(bool) If set to
.Ar YES
then run the
.Xr lpd 8
daemon at system boot time.
.It Ar lpd_flags
(str) If
.Ar lpd_enable
is set to
.Ar YES ,
these are the flags to pass to the
.Xr lpd 8
daemon.
.It Ar sendmail_enable
(bool) If set to
.Ar YES
then run the
.Xr sendmail 8
daemon at system boot time.
.It Ar sendmail_flags
(str) If
.Ar sendmail_enable
is set to
.Ar YES ,
these are the flags to pass to the
.Xr sendmail 8
daemon.
.It Ar savecore_enable
(bool) If set to
.Ar YES
then save kernel crashdumps for debugging purposes when the system
comes back up after a crash.  Crash images are typically stored in the
.Pa /var/crash
directory.
.It Ar dumpdev
(str) If not set to
.Ar NO
then point kernel crash-dumps at the swap device
specified as 
.Em value .
.It Ar check_quotas
(bool) Set to
.Ar YES
if you want to enable user disk quota checking via the 
.Xr quotacheck 8
command.
.It Ar accounting_enable
(bool) Set to
.Ar YES
if you wish to enable system accounting through the 
.Xr accton 8
facility.
.It Ar ibcs2_enable
(bool) Set to
.Ar YES
if you wish to enable iBCS2 (SCO) binary emulation at system initial boot
time.
.It Ar linux_enable
(bool) Set to
.Ar YES
if you wish to enable Linux/ELF binary emulation at system initial
boot time.
.It Ar rand_irqs
(str) Set to the list of IRQs to monitor for random number creation
(see the man page for
.Xr rndcontrol 8 ).
.It Ar clear_tmp_enable
(bool) Set to
.Ar YES
if you want
.Pa /tmp
to be cleaned at startup.
.It Ar ldconfig_paths
(str) Set to the list of shared library paths to use with
.Xr ldconfig 8 .
NOTE:
.Pa /usr/lib
will always be added first, so it need not appear in this list.
.It Ar kern_securelevel_enable
(bool) Set to 
.Ar YES
if you wish to set the kernel security level at system startup.
.It Ar kern_securelevel
(int) The kernel security level to set at startup.
The allowed range of 
.Ar value
ranges from -1 (the compile time default) to 3 (the
most secure).  See
.Xr init 8
for the list of possible security levels and their effect
on system operation.
