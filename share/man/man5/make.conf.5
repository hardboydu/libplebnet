.Sh NAME
.Nm make.conf
.Nd system build information.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm
contains settings that control the compilation of the FreeBSD sources
and ported applications. The file 
.Nm
is generally created by the system administrator when the values need
to be changed from their defaults.
.Pp
The purpose of
.Nm
is not to run commands or perform compilation actions
directly.  Instead, it is included by the
various makefiles in
.Pa /usr/src,
.Pa /usr/ports
and
.Pa /usr/doc
which conditionalize their
internal actions according to the settings found there.
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/make.conf
file is included from the the appropriate Makefile
which specifies the default settings for all the available options.
Options need only be specified in 
.Pa /etc/make.conf
when the system administrator wishes to override these defaults.
.Pp
The build procedures occur in four broad areas: the world, the kernel,
documentations and ports. Variables set in
.Nm
may be applicable during builds in one, two, or all four of these
areas. They may be specified for a particular build via the
.Op -D
option of
.Xr make 1 .
.Pp
The following lists provides a name and short description for each
variable you can use during the indicated builds. The values of
variables flagged as
bool
are ignored; the variable being
set at all (even to 
.Li Dq FALSE
or
.Li Dq NO )
cause it to
be treated as if it were set.
.Pp
The following list provides a name and short description for variables
that are used for all builds, or are used by the
makefiles for things other than builds.
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar CFLAGS
(str) Controls the compiler setting when compiling C code.
Optimization levels above
.Op -O ( -O2 , ...)

CXXFLAGS is initially set to the value of CFLAGS. If you want to
add to the CXXFLAGS value, use 
.Dq Li +=
instead of
.Dq Li = .

the install, use
.Bd -literal -offset indent
INSTALL="install -C"

.It Ar BOOTWAIT
(int) Controls the amount of time the kernel waits for a console keypress
