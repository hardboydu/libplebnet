.Sh NAME
.Nm portsnap.conf
.Nd configuration file for 
.Xr portsnap 8
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file controls where
.Xr portsnap 8
fetches ports tree snapshots from,
which RSA key should be trusted to sign the updates, and what
directories should hold the compressed and live ports trees.
.Pp
A line of the form
.Dl SERVERNAME=portsnap.example.com
specifies the source from which snapshots should be fetched.
This is equivalent to the
.Fl s Ar server
option to 
.Xr portsnap 8 , and will be ignored if the command-line
option is used.
.Pp
A line of the form
.Dl KEYPRINT=0123456789abc ... 456789abcdef
(64 characters in total)
specifies the SHA-256 hash of the OpenSSL public key file
belonging to an RSA keypair which is trusted to sign updates.
This is equivalent to the
.Fl k Ar KEY
option to 
.Xr portsnap 8 , and will be ignored if the command-line
option is used.
.Pp
A line of the form
.Dl WORKDIR=/path/to/workdir
specifies the directory in which portsnap should maintain its compressed
snapshot of the ports tree.
This is equivalent to the
.Fl d Ar workdir
option to
.Xr portsnap 8 , and will be ignored if the command-line option
is used.
.Pp
A line of the form
.Dl PORTSDIR=/path/to/portstree
specifies the directory in which portsnap will create the live ports
tree from its compressed snapshot via the
.Cm extract
and
.Cm update
commands.
This is equivalent to the
.Fl p Ar portsdir
option to
.Xr portsnap 8 , and will be ignored if the command-line option
is used.
.Pp
If more than one line of any of the above forms is included in
.Nm
then only the last one will take effect.  Any lines not of the above
forms will be ignored.
