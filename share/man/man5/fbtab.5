.Nm fbtab
.Nd change device protection upon login
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains a number of lines specifying a device together with a list
of devices with associated protections.
Comments start with a # and extend to the end of the line.
.Pp
Blank lines or lines with only a comment are ignored.
.Pp
All other lines consist of three fields delimited by
whitespace: a login device (/dev/ttyv0), an octal
permission number (0600), and a ":"-delimited list of
devices (/dev/console). All device names are
absolute paths.
A path that ends in "/*" refers to all
directory entries except "." and "..".
.Pp
If the tty argument (relative path) matches a login device
name (absolute path), the permissions of the devices in the
":"-delimited list are set as specified in the second
field, and their ownership is changed to that of the uid
and gid arguments.
