ADMtek AN986 Pegasus USB Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device uhci0"
.Cd "device ohci0"
.Cd "device usb0"
.Cd "device miibus0"
.Cd "device aue0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB ethernet adapters based on the ADMtek
AN986 Pegasus chipset, including the LinkSys USB100TX, the Billionton
Systems USB100, the Melco Inc. LU-ATX, the D-Link DSB-650TX and the
SMC 2202USB.
.Pp
The Pegasus contains a 10/100
ethernet MAC with MII interface and is designed to work with both
ethernet and HomePNA transceivers. Although designed to interface with
100Mbps peripherals, the existing USB standard specifies a maximum
transfer speed of 12Mbps. Users should therefore not expect to actually
achieve 100Mbps speeds with these devices.
.Pp
The Pegasus supports a 64-bit multicast hash table, single perfect
filter entry for the station address and promiscuous mode. Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file.
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation. The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to enable
.Ar full-duplex
operation. Not specifying
.Ar full duplex
implies
.Ar half-duplex
mode.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (fast ethernet) operation. The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to enable
.Ar full-duplex
operation. Not specifying
.Ar full duplex
implies
.Ar half-duplex
mode.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation. The interface will operate in
half duplex mode if this media option is not specified.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "aue%d: watchdog timeout"
A packet was queued for transmission and a transmit command was
issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the transmission
before a timeout expired.
.It "aue%d: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 4.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Paul Aq wpaul@ee.columbia.edu .
.Sh BUGS
For some reason, outgoing bulk transfers (i.e. packet transmissions)
fail if the transfer is exactly a multiple of 64 bytes in size. The
.Nm
driver works around this by padding such transfers up by one additional
byte. This does not affect connectivity, however it does cause packets
to occasionaly appear on the wire with one additional byte for no good
reason. It is not known if this bug is due to a problem with Pegasus
chip itself or some peculiarity of the underlying USB support.
