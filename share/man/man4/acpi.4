.Sh NAME
.Nm acpi
.Nd Advanced Configuration and Power Management support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device acpica
.Pp
.Cd options ACPI_DEBUG
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Intel/Microsoft/Compaq/Toshiba ACPI
standard.
This support includes platform hardware discovery (superseding the
PnP and PCI BIOS), as well as power management (superseding APM) and
other features.
ACPI core support is provided by the ACPI CA reference implementation
from Intel.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
This support is still experimental, and thus there are many debugging
and tuning options which are managed via the kernel environment
space, and set in the loader before booting the kernel.
.Pp
Debugging is separated between layers and levels, where a layer is
a portion of the ACPI subsystem, and a level is a particular kind
of debugging output.
.Pp
Both layers and levels are specified as a whitespace-separated list of
tokens, with layers listed in
.Va debug.acpi.layer
and levels in
.Va debug.acpi.level .
The supported layers are:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact

.Pp
Selection of the appropriate layer and level values is important
to avoid massive amounts of debugging output.
Check the code to see which you need.
.Pp
Debugging output by the ACPI CA subsystem is prefixed with the
module name in lowercase, followed by a source line number.
Output from the FreeBSD-local code follows the same format, but
the module name is uppercased.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver comprises a set of drivers, which may be selectively disabled
in case of problems.
To disable a sub-driver, list it in the kernel
environment variable
.Va debug.acpi.disable .
.Pp
ACPI sub-devices and features that can be disabled:
.Bl -tag -width processor
.It bus
.Pq Vt feature
Probes and attaches subdevices.
Disabling will avoid scanning the ACPI namespace entirely.
.It children
.Pq Vt feature
Attaches standard ACPI sub-drivers and devices enumerated in the
ACPI namespace.
Disabling this has a similar effect to disabling
.Dq bus ,
except that the
ACPI namespace will still be scanned.
.It button
.Pq Vt device
Supports ACPI button devices (typically power and sleep buttons).
.It ec
.Pq Vt device
Supports the ACPI Embedded Controller interface, used to
communicate with embedded platform controllers.
.It isa
.Pq Vt device
Supports an ISA bus bridge defined in the ACPI namespace,
typically as a child of a PCI bus.
.It lid
.Pq Vt device
Supports an ACPI laptop lid switch, which typically puts a
system to sleep.
.It pci
.Pq Vt device
Supports Host to PCI bridges.
.It processor
.Pq Vt device
Supports CPU power-saving and speed-setting functions.
.It thermal
.Pq Vt device
Supports system cooling and heat management.
.It timer
.Pq Vt device
Implements a timecounter using the ACPI fixed-frequency timer.
.El
.Pp
It is also possible to avoid portions of the ACPI namespace which
may be causing problems, by listing the full path of the root of
the region to be avoided in the kernel environment variable
.Va debug.acpi.avoid .
The object and all of its children will be ignored during the
bus/children scan of the namespace.  The ACPI CA code will still
know about the avoided region.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
ACPI is only found/supported on Intel platforms (i386/IA32 and IA64).

.Sh BUGS
The kernel device is
.Cd device acpica
for historical reasons.  It will change to
.Cd device acpi
at some time in the future.
