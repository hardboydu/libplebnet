.Nm su
.Nd scsi user-level driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm device-driver su
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm su
driver provides support for a 
process to address arbitrary locations on the scsi bus. Minor
numbers are mapped 1:1 to bus:target:lun. The lowest three bits being LUN
and the next three bits being TARGET. Remaining bits are the bus number.
.Pp
A scsi adapter must also be separately configured into the system
before this driver makes sense.

.Sh THE SU DEVICE IS NOT COMPLETED YET
.Sh KERNEL CONFIGURATION
There are no configuration parameters for the su option. It'e either there
or it's not.

.Sh IOCTLS
The 
.Nm
driver has no ioctls of it's own but rather acts as a medium for the

ioctls. These are described in
.Em sys/scsiio.h.
