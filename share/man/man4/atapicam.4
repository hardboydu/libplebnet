.Dt ATAPICAM 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm atapicam
.Nd CAM XPT (transport) module for ATAPI devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device atapicam"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The ATAPI/CAM module allows ATAPI devices (CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD drives,
floppy drives such as Iomega Zip, tape drives) to be accessed through
the SCSI subsystem (CAM). 
.Pp
.Nm ata
and
.Nm scbus
must be configured in the kernel as well.
The SCSI target drivers
.Pq Nm cd , Nm da , No or Nm st
can then be used to access the devices.
The generic passthrough device
.Nm pass
can also be used to send SCSI commands directly
to the devices through the CAM API.
.Pp
A separate CAM bus is created for each ATA bus in the system.
On each of these buses, target id 0 is assigned to the master
device, and id 1 is assigned to the slave
.Pq provided they are ATAPI devices .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Some SCSI commands are intercepted by the driver, and undergo special
processing in order to work around limitations of ATAPI devices.
Such limitations can be consequences of the ATAPI specification.
For example, ATAPI devices do not implement the 6-byte versions
of
.Nm MODE_SELECT ,
.Nm MODE_SENSE ,
.Nm READ ,
or
.Nm WRITE .
They can also be common bugs, such as hanging when queried for
extended
.Nm INQUIRY
information.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl device atapicam
.Dl device scbus
.Dl device cd
.Dl device pass
.Pp
Add the
.Nm
driver to the kernel.
.Pp
.Dl camcontrol devlist
.Pp
Print the list of all devices available through CAM.
.Pp
.Dl mount -t cd9660 /dev/cd0c /mnt
.Pp
Mount a CD-ROM from an ATAPI CD-ROM drive
.Pq the command above assumes that the ATAPI drive is the only CD-ROM unit .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ata 4 ,
.Xr scsi 4 ,
.Xr atacontrol 8 ,
.Xr camcontrol 8
.Sh HISTORY
The ATAPI/CAM driver first appeared in
.Fx 5.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The ATAPI/CAM driver was written by
.An Thomas Quinot Aq thomas@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
.Pp
.Nm
and ATAPI-specific target drivers
.Pq Nm acd , Nm ast , No and Nm afd
can be configured in the same kernel.
Simultaneous access to the same device through the SCSI generic drivers
and the ATAPI-specific drivers may cause problems and is strongly discouraged.
