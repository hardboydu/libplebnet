.Sh NAME
.Nm fatm
.Nd Device driver for Fore PCA200E ATM interfaces
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device fatm
.Cd device utopia
.Cd options atm
.Cd options NATM
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports the FORE (now Marconi) PCA200E ATM interface cards.
The driver interfaces with the
.Xr natm 4
framework,
.Xr netgraph 4
and HARP.
It provides only PVC services. Signalling, ATMARP, ILMI and other
higher layer protocols are implemented using
.Xr netgraph 4
or HARP.
.Pp
For configuring the card for IP see
.Xr natmip 4 .
The following sysctls are recognized by the driver additionally to those
handled by
.Xr utopia 4 :
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It Cm hw.atm.fatmN.stats
Returns a device specific statistic list of
.Dv uint32_t
statistic counters.
.It Cm hw.atm.fatmN.istats
Returns a list of
.Dv uint32_t
with internal driver statistics.
.It Cm hw.atm.fatmN.retry_tx
If this is set packets are stuffed back into the interface's send queue when
the cards transmit queue is found to be full. They are transmitted later.
If this is not set the packets are dropped. It may be useful to set this
if only UBR traffic is sent.
.It Cm hw.atm.fatmN.debug
.Em (only if debugging enabled)
These are debugging flags. See
.Fn if_fatmvar.h
for the possible flags.
.El
.Pp
The driver supports the media options
.Ar sdh ,
.Ar noscramb
and
.Ar unassigned
(see
.Xr utopia 4 ).

.Sh BUGS
These cards can CBR shape a single VCC only. It is currently possible to
request more than one CBR connection. In this case all the timing will be
wrong. See
.Xr hatm 4
for a better card.
