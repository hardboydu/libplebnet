.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the D-Link/GEMTEK FM tuner.
The USB interface chip is the common Cypress 63001, and the tuner is a
Philips TEA5757 radio chip that uses a serial interface to set the
tuner parameters.
This design is used in the D-Link DSB-R100 USB Radio.

The
.Nm
device must be configured in the kernel, along with
.Em usb
and one of the
.Em uhci
or
.Em ohci
controllers.
.Pp
Subsequently, the
.Pa /dev/ufm0
device can be used by userland applications.
