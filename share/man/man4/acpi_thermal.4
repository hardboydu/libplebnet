.Sh NAME
.Nm acpi_thermal
.Nd ACPI Thermal Management Support Subsystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device acpi"
.Pp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides ACPI thermal handling feature as a part of
ACPI module. This module has sysctl interface and devd notification
interface. Sysctls export ACPI objects as is.
The
.Nm
driver also activate active cooling system in accordance with appropriate
acpi object.
.Sh SYSCTLS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d.active
Current active system running state.
.It Va hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d.thermal_flags
Current thermal zone status. This is bit-masked values.
.It Va hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d.temperature
exports _TMP object that means current temperature.
.It Va hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d._PSV
exports _PSV object that means the temperature to start 
passive cooling by throtting down CPU etc..
.It Va hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d._HOT
exports _HOT object that means the temperature to 
start critical suspend to disk 
.It Va hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d._CRT
exports _CRT object that means the temperature to 
start critical shutdown.
.It Va hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d._ACx
exports _ACx objects that objects that means active 
cooling start values. The earlier value means the strengest
active cooling temperature.
.El
All temperature is represents as tenth of Kelvin. For example
300.0K is represented as by the integer 3000. To convert to Centigrade,
the formula is (x - 2731.5) / 10.
.Sh NOTIFYS
Notifies are passed as a string beginning with 
"!system=ACPI subsystem=Thermal" the thermal zone instance
is distingushed by ACPI object path in "type=" argument. The notify
value is passed in "notify=" argument.
