.Sh NAME
.Nm urtw
.Nd Realtek RTL8187L USB IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ehci"
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device urtw"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time,
place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_urtw_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports USB 802.11b/g wireless adapters based on the
Realtek RTL8187L.
.Pp
.Nm
supports
.Cm station
and
.Cm monitor
mode operation.
Only one virtual interface may be configured at any time.
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The following adapters should work:
.Pp
.Bl -column "Card                        " "Radio    " "Bus" -compact -offset 6n
.It Em "Card	Radio	Bus"
.It Li "Netgear WG111v2" Ta RTL8225 Ta USB
.It Li "Safehome WLG-1500SMA5" Ta RTL8225 Ta USB
.It Li "Shuttle XPC Accessory PN20" Ta RTL8225 Ta USB
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev urtw0 inet 192.168.0.20 \e
    netmask 0xffffff00
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig wlan create wlandev urtw0 ssid my_net up"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
