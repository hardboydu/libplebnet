.Sh NAME
.Nm nmdm
.Nd nullmodem terminal driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device nmdm"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides two 
.Xr tty 4
devices connected
by a virtual "null modem" cable.
.Pp
If either of the two tty devices have the CDSR_OFLOW bit
("stty dsrflow")
set in their line discipline, the 
.Nm
device will emulate the speed configured in the
.Xr termios 4
settings.
The speed emulation works independently in the two directions,
controlled by the slower ends termios settings (c_ispeed, c_ospeed,
CS5...CS8, CSTOPB and PARENB).
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/nmdm[N][AB] -compact
.It Pa /dev/nmdm Ns Ar N Ns Op Pa AB
nullmodem device nodes.
Where the
.Pa A
node has a matching
.Pa B
node.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver implements "on-demand device creation" so simply accessing a
given instance in /dev will create it.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
None.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr stty 1 ,
.Xr termios 4 ,
.Xr tty 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 4.4 .
