.Sh NAME
.Nm ALTQ
.Nd Alternate queuing of network packets
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
framework provides several disciplines for queuing outgoing network packets.
This is done by modifications to the interface packet queues.
See
.Xr altq 9
for details.
.Pp
The user interface for
.Nm
is implemented by the
.Xr pfctl 8
utility, so please refer to the
.Xr pfctl 8
and the
.Xr pf.conf 5
manpages for a complete description of the
.Nm
capabilities and how to use it.
.Ss Kernel Options
The following options in the kernel configuration file are related to
.Nm
operation:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv ALTQ_DEBUG" -compact
.It Dv ALTQ
enable
.Nm
.It Dv ALTQ_CBQ
build the
.Dq "Class Based Queuing"
discipline.
.It Dv ALTQ_RED
build the
.Dq "Random Early Drop"
extension.
.It Dv ALTQ_RIO
build
.Dq "Random Early Drop"
for input and output.
.It Dv ALTQ_HFSC
build the
.Dq "Hierarchical Packet Scheduler"
discipline.
.It Dv ALTQ_CDNR
build the traffic conditioner.
This option is meaningless at the moment as the conditioner is not used by
any of the available disciplines or consumer.
.It Dv ALTQ_PRIQ
build the
.Dq "Priority Queuing"
discipline.
.It Dv ALTQ_NOPCC
required for SMP builds.
.It Dv ALTQ_DEBUG
enable additional debugging facilities.
.El
.Pp
Note that
.Nm Ns -disciplines
can not be loaded as kernel modules.
In order to use a certain discipline you have to build it into a custom
kernel.
The
.Xr pf 4
interface, that is required for the configuration process of
.Nm
can be loaded as a module.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
The driver modifications described in
.Xr altq 9
and required to use a certain network card with
.Nm
have been applied to the following hardware drivers
.Xr an 4 ,
.Xr ath 4 ,
.Xr awi 4 ,
.Xr bfe 4 ,
.Xr bge 4 ,
.Xr dc 4 ,
.Xr em 4 ,
.Xr fxp 4 ,
.Xr hme 4 ,
.Xr lnc 4 ,
.Xr wi 4 ,
.Xr de 4 ,
.Xr rl 4 ,
.Xr sis 4 ,
.Xr vr 4
and
.Xr xl 4 .
.Pp
The
.Xr ndis 4
framework also has support for
.Nm
and thus all encapsulated drivers.
.Pp
The
.Xr tun 4
pseudo driver also does support
.Nm
and includes the required modifications.
