.Sh NAME
.Nm cx
.Nd driver for synchronous/asynchronous Cronyx-Sigma WAN adapters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device cx"
.Pp
Additional options:
.Cd "device sppp"
.Cd "options NETGRAPH"
.Cd "options NETGRAPH_CRONYX"
.Pp
In
.Pa /boot/device.hints :
.Cd hint.cx.0.at="isa"
.Cd hint.cx.0.port="0x240"
.Cd hint.cx.0.irq="15"
.Cd hint.cx.0.drq="7"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver needs either
.Xr sppp 4
or 
.Xr netgraph 4 .
Which one to use is determined by the NETGRAPH_CRONYX option.
If this option is present in your kernel configuration file, the
.Nm
driver will be compiled with
.Xr netgraph 4
support.
Otherwise, it will be compiled with
.Xr sppp 4
support.
.Pp
The base I/O port address specified in
.Pa /boot/device.hints
must match the port address set by the jumpers on the board.
The DMA I/O channel and interrupt request numbers are configured
by software at adapter initialization.
Legal values are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width Port:
.It Port :
0x240, 0x260, 0x280, 0x300, 0x320, 0x380
.It IRQ :
3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15
.It DMA :
5, 6, 7
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports autodetection.
As for all non-PNP hardware, using
autodetection could lead to some potential problems with other devices during
the hardware detection process.
It is always better to specify hardware resources manually.
.Pp
Refer to
.Xr sconfig 8
for information about the
.Nm
adapter configuration.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was updated in
.Fx 5.2 .
In most of the previous versions of
.Fx
the
.Nm
driver is out of date.
The
.Nm
driver for previous versions of
.Fx
is available from
.Pa http://www.cronyx.ru/ .
