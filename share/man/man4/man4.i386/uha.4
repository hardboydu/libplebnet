Ultrastore SCSI host adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.sp
For Ultrastore 24f controllers in EISA mode:
.Cd "controller uha0 at isa? bio irq 14 vector uhaintr
.Cd "controller scbus0
.sp
For Ultrastore 14f and 34f controllers:
.Cd "controller uha0 at isa? port" \&"IO_UHA0\&" bio irq 14 drq 5 vector uhaintr
.Cd "controller scbus0
.sp
For each disk:
.Cd "device sd0
.sp
For each tape device:
.Cd "device st0
.sp
For one or more cdroms:
.Cd "device cd0
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to SCSI devices connected to an Ultrastore
Ultrastore 14f, Ultrastore 24f or Ultrastore 34f hostadapter.
.sp
Note that for an Ultrastore 24f in EISA mode no I/O addresses or DMA channels 
are required in the kernel config file. If they are present, the driver
will correctly find the Ultrastore 24f, but you tie up precious DMA channels
and I/O ranges which are not used by the card.
The Ultrastore 24f uses EISA slot specific I/O which is configured 
automatically.
