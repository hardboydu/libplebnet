PC architecture floppy disk controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "controller fdc0 at isa? port" \&"IO_FD1\&" bio irq 6 drq 2 vector fdintr
.Cd "disk fd0 at fdc0 drive 0
.Cd "disk fd1 at fdc0 drive 1
.Pp
For QIC40 and QIC80 tapedrives controlled by the floppy controller:
.Cd "tape ft0 at fdc0 drive 2
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to floppy disk drives and QIC40/80 tapedrives.
In /dev for each floppy device a number of minor devices are present. The
/dev/fd* devices with trailing alphabetic characters are used to indicate
'partitions' on the floppy disk. The /dev/fd*.<number> are devices that
indicate the size of the floppy disk (so: 720kB, 1440kB etc). The latter
are used for formatting disks using fdformat or for accessing different
density disks in multidensity drive. Example: 720kB disk in a 1.44Mb drive.
