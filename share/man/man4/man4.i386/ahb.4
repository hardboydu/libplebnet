Adaptec EISA SCSI host adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "controller ahb0 at isa? bio irq ? vector ahbintr
.Cd "controller scbus0
.sp
For each disk:
.Cd "device sd0
.sp
For each tape device:
.Cd "device st0
.sp
For one or more cdroms:
.Cd "device cd0
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to SCSI devices connected to an Adaptec 
174x hostadapter in either Standard or Enhanced Mode. If the controller
is set to Standard mode (by the ECU), the driver will automatically 
switch the card to Enhanced mode during the device probe.
.sp
Please note that the above implies that when you are configuring a system
with both aha and ahb drivers, the ahb driver should be listed first in the
kernel config file. This ensures that the ahb driver will find the Adaptec 174x
boards before the aha driver probes for Adaptec 154x boards.
.sp
Note that no I/O addresses are configured in the kernel config file. The
174x uses EISA slot specific I/O which is configured automatically.
