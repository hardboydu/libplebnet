.Sh NAME
.Nm cxgbe
.Nd "Chelsio T4 10Gb and 1Gb Ethernet adapter driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device cxgbe"
.Ed
.Pp
To load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_cxgbe_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI Express Ethernet adapters based on
the Chelsio Terminator 4 (T4) ASIC.
The driver supprts Jumbo Frames, Transmit/Receive checksum offload,
TCP segmentation offload (TSO), Large Receive Offload (LRO), VLAN
tag insertion/extraction, VLAN checksum offload, VLAN TSO, and
Receive Side Steering (RSS).
For further hardware information and questions related to hardware
requirements, see
.Pa http://www.chelsio.com/ .
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports 10Gb and 1Gb Ethernet adapters based on the T4 ASIC:

.Xr loader.conf 5 .
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.cxgbe.max_ntxq_10G_port
The maximum number of tx queues to use for a 10Gb port.
The default value is 8.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.max_nrxq_10G_port
The maximum number of rx queues to use for a 10Gb port.
The default value is 8.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.max_ntxq_1G_port
The maximum number of tx queues to use for a 1Gb port.
The default value is 2.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.max_nrxq_1G_port
The maximum number of rx queues to use for a 1Gb port.
The default value is 2.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.holdoff_timer_idx_10G
.It Va hw.cxgbe.holdoff_timer_idx_1G
The timer index value to use to delay interrupts.
The holdoff timer list has the values 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 200
by default (all values are in microseconds) and the index selects a
value from this list.
The default value is 1 for both 10Gb and 1Gb ports, which means the
timer value is 5us.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.holdoff_pktc_idx_10G
.It Va hw.cxgbe.holdoff_pktc_idx_1G
The packet-count index value to use to delay interrupts.
The packet-count list has the values 1, 8, 16, and 32 by default
and the index selects a value from this list.
The default value is 2 for both 10Gb and 1Gb ports, which means 16
packets (or the holdoff timer going off) before an interrupt is
generated.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.qsize_txq
The size, in number of entries, of the descriptor ring used for a tx
queue.
A buf_ring of the same size is also allocated for additional
software queuing.  See
.Xr ifnet 9 .
The default value is 1024.
.It Va hw.cxgbe.qsize_rxq
The size, in number of entries, of the descriptor ring used for an
rx queue.
The default value is 1024.
