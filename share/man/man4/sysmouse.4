.Sh NAME
.Nm sysmouse
.Nd supplies mouse data from syscons for other applications
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <machine/console.h>
.Ft int
.Fn ioctl cfd CONS_MOUSECTL struct\ *mouse_info
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Dv CONS_MOUSECTL
.Fn ioctl
call provides syscons with mouse information, which includes mouse movement
and button presses.  The
.Fn ioctl
also provides a method for a process to receive a
.Xr signal 3
when a button is pressed.
.Pp
.Xr moused 8
uses this
.Fn ioctl
to inform the console of mouse actions.  Applications
.Pq such as Tn X\ Windows
can use
.Pa /dev/sysmouse ,
allowing syscons and the application to share the mouse.
