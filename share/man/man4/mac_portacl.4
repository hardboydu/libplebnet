.Dt MAC_PORTACL 4
.Sh NAME
.Nm mac_portacl
.Nd network port access control policy
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile the port access control policy into your kernel,
place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:
.Cd "options MAC"
.Cd "options MAC_PORTACL"
.Pp
Alternately, to load the port access control policy module at boot time,
place the following line in your kernel configuration file:
.Cd "options MAC"
.Pp
and in   
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Cd mac_portacl_load= Ns \&"YES"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
policy allows administrators to administratively limit binding to
local UDP and TCP ports via the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface.
.Pp
In order to enable the
.Nm
policy, MAC policy must be enforced on sockets
(see
.Xr mac 4 ) ,
and the port(s) protected by
.Nm
must not be included in the range specified by
the
.Va net.inet.ip.portrange.reservedlow
and
.Va net.inet.ip.portrange.reservedhigh
.Xr sysctl 8
MIBs.
.Ss Runtime Configuration
The port access control list is specified in the
.Va security.mac.portacl.rules
.Xr sysctl 8
MIB in the following format:
.Pp
.Sm off
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Sy idtype
.Li :
.Sy id
.Li :
.Sy protocol
.Li :
.Sy port
.Li [,
.Sy idtype
.Li :
.Sy id
.Li :
.Sy protocol
.Li :
.Sy port
.Li ,...]
.Ed
.Sm on
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width protocol
.It Sy idtype
Describes the type of subject match to be performed.
Either
.Li uid
for userid matching, or
.Li gid
for group ID matching.
.It Sy id
The user or group ID (depending on
.Sy idtype )
allowed to bind to the specified port.
.Bf -emphasis
NOTE: User and group names are not valid; only the actual ID numbers
may be used.
.Ef
.It Sy protocol
Describes which protocol this entry applies to.
Either
.Li tcp
or
.Li udp
are supported.
.It Sy port
Describes which port this entry applies to.
.Bf -emphasis
NOTE: MAC security policies may not override other security system policies
by allowing accesses that they may deny, such as
.Va net.inet.ip.portrange.reservedlow /
.Va net.inet.ip.portrange.reservedhigh .
.Ef
If the specified port falls within the range specified, the
.Nm
entry will not function
(i.e. even the specified user/group may not be able to bind to the specified
port).
