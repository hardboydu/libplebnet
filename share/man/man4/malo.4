.Sh NAME
.Nm malo
.Nd "Marvell Libertas IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network device"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device malo"
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Cd "device firmware"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_malo_load="YES"
wlan_load="YES"
firmware_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
In both cases, place the following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5
to load the firmware modules:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
malofw_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Marvell Libertas 88W8335 based PCI
network adapters.
.Sh FILES
The driver needs a firmware kernel module which is used when
an interface is brought up.  This firmware files are comed from
.Ox
.Nm
driver.
.Pp
A port package for the firmware can be found at:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
http://weongyo.org/project/malo/malo-firmware-1.4.tar.gz
.Ed
.Pp
You need to install this port package manually before
.Xr ifconfig 8
will work.
.Sh HARDWARE
The following cards are among those supported by the
.Nm
driver:
.Pp
.Bl -column -compact "Microcom Travelcard" "MALO111" "CardBus" "a/b/g" -offset 6n
.Em "Card	Chip	Bus	Standard"
Netgear WG311v3	88W8335	PCI	b/g
Tenda TWL542P	88W8335	PCI	b/g
U-Khan UW-2054i	88W8335	PCI	b/g
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (ie: connect to an access point):
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig malo0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig malo0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig malo0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \e
        wepmode on wepkey 0x8736639624
