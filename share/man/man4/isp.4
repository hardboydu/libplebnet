.Sh NAME
.Nm isp
.Nd Qlogic based SCSI and FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device isp"
.Pp
For one or more SCSI busses:
.Cd device scbus0
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to
.Tn SCSI
or
.Tn FibreChannel
devices.
.Pp
SCSI features include support for Ultra SCSI and wide mode transactions for
.Tn SCSI ,
Ultra2 LVD (for the ISP1080 and ISP1280), and Ultra3 LVD (for the ISP12160).
.Pp
Fibre Channel support uses FCP SCSI profile for
.Tn FibreChannel .
and utilizes Class 3 and Class 2 connections (Qlogic 2100 is Class 3
only, minor patches to the Qlogic 2200 to force Class 2 mode).
Support is available for Public
and Private loops, and for point-to-point connections (Qlogic 2200
only).
Command tagging is supported for all (in fact,
.Tn FibreChannel
requires tagging).
.Sh HARDWARE
Supported cards include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx -offset indent
.It ISP1000
SBus Fast Wide, Ultra Fast Wide cards, Single Ended or Differential cards.
.It PTI SBS440
Perfomance Technology ISP1000 variants.
.It ISP1020

.It ISP1040
Qlogic 1040 Ultra Wide and Differential Ultra Wide PCI cards.
.It PTI SBS450

.It Qlogic 1080
Qlogic 1280 LVD Ultra2 Wide PCI cards.
.It Qlogic 1280
Qlogic 1280 Dual Bus LVD Ultra2 Wide PCI cards.
.It Qlogic 12160
Qlogic 12160 Dual Bus LVD Ultra3 Wide PCI cards.
.It Qlogic 2100
Qlogic 2100 and 2100A Copper and Optical Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop
.It Qlogic 2102
Qlogic Dual Loop 2100A Optical Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop PCI cards.
.It Qlogic 2200

.Sh CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
.Pp
General configuration options for all adapters include:
.sp
.Cd options SCSI_ISP_NO_FWLOAD_MASK
.Cd options SCSI_ISP_NO_NVRAM_MASK
.Cd options SCSI_ISP_PREFER_MEM_MAP
.sp
for which the option value is a bit mask of units for which you want this
option to apply.
The options are, respectively, for not loading new firmware
at startup, ignoring card NVRAM settings, and preferring memory mapped
versus I/O port PCI access methods.
.Pp
Poorly debugged and prototype target mode support may be enabled with the
.sp
.Cd options ISP_TARGET_MODE
.sp
option.
.Pp
Configuration options that define whether downloadable firmware should be
compiled into the driver are:
.sp
.Cd options ISP_COMPILE_1020_FW
.Cd options ISP_COMPILE_1080_FW
.Cd options ISP_COMPILE_12160_FW
.Cd options ISP_COMPILE_2100_FW
.Cd options ISP_COMPILE_FW
.sp
The above options either select which board's f/w you wish to compile in,
or for the last, to select all.
.Pp
Configuration options specific to Fibre Channel Cards are:
.sp
.Cd options SCSI_ISP_FCDUPLEX
.Cd options SCSI_ISP_FABRIC
.Cd options SCSI_ISP_SCCLUN
.Cd options SCSI_ISP_WWN
.sp
The first option is a bit mask of units for which you want to enable full
duplex mode.
This typically would only make sense if fabric support is
enabled and you are directly connected to a switch.
The second defines whether Fibre Channel Fabric support should be enabled.
The third defines whether whether the first level SCC lun support should
be enabled- this converts the normal 16 Logical Unit support to support for
65536 Logical Units.
The last option should be a string that defines an
overriding World Wide Node Name (WWNN) should you wish to override NVRAM
settings.
It is recommended that you compile in firmware if you select
any of these options.
.Sh BOOT OPTIONS
.Pp
Many of the above options are switchable by setting values in the loader
configuration file (see the
.Xr loader 8
manual page). They are:
.sp
.Bl -tag -width "isp_no_fwload" -compact
.It isp_disable
A bit mask of units to skip configuration for.
.It isp_mem_map
A bit mask of units to use PCI Memory space instead of I/O
space access for.
.It isp_io_map
A bit mask of units to use PCI I/O space instead of Memory
space access for.
.It isp_no_fwload
A bit mask of units that you wish to skip firmware download for.
.It isp_fwload
A bit mask of units that you wish to *do* firmware download for.
.It isp_no_nvram
A bit mask of units that you wish to ignore board NVRAM settings for.
.It isp_nvram
A bit mask of units that you wish to specifically use board NVRAM settings for.
.It isp_fcduplex
A bit mask of units that you wish to specifically to set into full
duplex mode.
.It isp_no_fcduplex
A bit mask of units that you wish to specifically to not set into full
duplex mode.
.It isp_wwn
This should be the full 64 bit World Wide Node Name you would like to
use, overriding the value in NVRAM for the card.
.It isp_debug
This is a driver debug level- meaningful from 0 through 7.
.It isp_tdebug
This is a driver target mode debug level- meaningful from 0 through 5.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The driver currently ignores some NVRAM settings.
.Pp
The driver currently doesn't do error recovery for timed out commands
very gracefully.
.Pp
Fabric support isn't very well debugged yet, and with some switches,
fails to work as well as it should because the driver uses the GET ALL NEXT
Simple Name Server subcommand which some switches don't handle as well
as they should.
.Pp
Sometimes, when booting, the driver gets stuck waiting for the Fibre Channel
f/w to tell it that the loop port database is ready.
In this case you'll
see an announcement that the loop state has a value of 0x1. To unwedge
the system, unplug and replug the fibre channel connection, or otherwise
cause a LIP (Loop Initialization Primitive sequence)- this will kick the f/w
into getting unstuck.
