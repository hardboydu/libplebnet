.Sh NAME
.Nm mac_bsdextended
.Nd file system firewall policy
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile the file system firewall policy into your kernel,
place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:
.Cd "options MAC"
.Cd "options MAC_BSDEXTENDED"
.Pp
Alternately, to load the file system firewall policy module at boot time,
place the following line in your kernel configuration file:
.Cd "options MAC"
.Pp
and in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Cd mac_bsdextended_load= Ns \&"YES"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides an interface for the system administrator
to impose mandatory rules regarding users and some system objects.
Rules are uploaded to the module
(typically using
.Xr ugidfw 8 ,
or some other tool utilizing
.Xr libugidfw 3 )
where they are stored internally
and used to determine whether to allow or deny specific accesses
(see
.Xr ugidfw 8 ) .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
While the traditional
.Xr mac 9
entry points are implemented,
policy labels are not used;
instead, access control decisions are made by iterating through the internal
list of rules until a rule
which denies the particular access
is found,
or the end of the list is reached.
