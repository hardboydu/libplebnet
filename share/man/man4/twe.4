.Sh NAME
.Nm twe
.Nd 3ware Escalade ATA RAID adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device pci
.Cd device twe
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Escalade 3W-5x00 series of ATA RAID
controllers.  These devices support 2, 4 or 8 ATA disk drives and provide
RAID0 (striping) and RAID1 (mirroring) functionality.  
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Controller initialisation phase:
.Bl -diag
.It twe%d: microcontroller not ready
.El
.Pp
The controller's onboard CPU is not reporting that it is ready; this may be
due to either a board or system failure.  Initialisation has failed.
.Bl -diag
.It twe%d: no attention interrupt
.It twe%d: can't drain AEN queue
.It twe%d: reset not reported
.It twe%d: controller errors detected
.It twe%d: can't drain response queue
.It twe%d: reset %d failed, trying again
.El
.Pp
The controller is not responding correctly to the driver's attempts to reset
and initialise it.  This process is retried several times.
.Bl -diag
.It twe%d: can't initialise controller, giving up
.El
.Pp
Several attempts to reset and initialise the controller have failed;
initialisation has failed and the driver will not attach to this controller.
.Pp
Driver initialisation/shutdown phase:
.Bl -diag
.It twe%d: register window not available
.It twe%d: can't allocate register window
.It twe%d: can't allocate parent DMA tag
.It twe%d: can't allocate interrupt
.It twe%d: can't set up interrupt
.It twe%d: can't establish configuration hook
.El
.Pp
A resource allocation error occurred while initialising the driver;
initialisation has failed and the driver will not attach to this
controller.
.Bl -diag
.It twe%d: can't detect attached units
.El
.Pp
Fetching the list of attached units failed; initialisation has failed.
.Bl -diag
.It twe%d: error fetching capacity for unit %d
.It twe%d: device_add_child failed
.It twe%d: bus_generic_attach returned %d
.El
.Pp
Creation of the disk devices failed; attachment of one or more units may have
been aborted.
.Bl -diag
.It twe%d: command failed - 0x%x
.It twe%d: command failed - controller wedged
.El
.Pp
A command was reported as failed by the controller, or could not be delivered to
the controller.
.Bl -diag
.It twe%d: host interrupt
.El
.Pp
The controller has signalled a host interrupt.  This serves an unknown purpose
and is ignored.
.Bl -diag
.It twe%d: command interrupt
.El
.Pp
The controller has signalled a command interrupt.  This is not used, and will
be disabled.
.Bl -diag
.It twe%d: error polling for signalled AENs
.El
.Pp
The controller has reported that one or more status messages are ready for the
driver, but attempting to fetch one of these has returned an error.
.Bl -diag
.It twe%d: AEN queue overflow, lost AEN <%s>
.El
.Pp
A status message was retrieved from the controller, but there is no more room
to queue it in the driver.  The message is lost.
.Bl -diag
.It twe%d: missing expected status bits %s
.It twe%d: unexpected status bits %s
.El
.Pp
A check of the controller's status bits indicates an unexpected condition.
.Sh BUGS
Much of the controller's status cannot currently be interpreted due to
lack of information from 3ware.
.Pp
The controller cannot handle I/O transfers that are not aligned to a 512-byte
boundary.  In order to support raw device access from user-space, the driver will
perform alignment fixup on non-aligned data.  This process is inefficient, and
thus in order to obtain best performance user-space applications accessing the 
device should do so with aligned buffers.
