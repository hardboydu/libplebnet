.Sh NAME
.Nm SMP
.Nd description of the FreeBSD Symmetric MultiProcessor kernel
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
kernel implements symmetric multiprocessor support.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Support for multi-processor systems is present for all supported
architectures on FreeBSD.
Currently, this includes alpha, i386, ia64, and sparc64.
.Pp
For i386 systems, the
.Nm
kernel supports motherboards that follow the Intel MP specification,
version 1.4.
On i386 systems, the
.Xr mptable 1
command may be used to view the status of multi-processor support.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mptable 1 ,
.Xr condvar 9 ,
.Xr msleep 9 ,
.Xr mtx_pool 9 ,
.Xr mutex 9 ,
.Xr sema 9 ,
.Xr sx 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
kernel's early history is not (properly) recorded.  It was developed
in a separate CVS branch until April 26, 1997, at which point it was
merged into 3.0-current.  By this date 3.0-current had already been
merged with Lite2 kernel code.
.Pp
.Fx 5.0
introduced support for a host of new synchronization primitives, and
a move towards fine-grained kernel locking rather than reliance on
a Giant kernel lock.
The SMPng Project relied heavily on the support of BSDi, who provided
reference source code from the fine-grained SMP implementation found
in BSD/OS.
