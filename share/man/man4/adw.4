.Sh NAME
.Nm adw
.Nd Advansys PCI 16bit SCSI Host adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd controller pci0
.Cd controller adw0
.Pp
For one or more SCSI busses:
.Cd controller scbus0 at adw0
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to the 16bit
.Tn SCSI
bus connected to the Advanced Systems Products, Inc.
.Tn ASC3550 
as found on the ABP940UW SCSI Host Adapter board.  This chip
supports, Ultra SCSI (20MHz), 16bit transfers, tagged queueing,
and up to 253 concurrent SCSI transactions.
.Pp
Per target configuration performed in the 
.Tn AdvanceWare
menu, which is accessible at boot,
is honored by this driver.
This includes synchronous/asynchronous transfers,
maximum synchronous negotiation rate, wide transfers, disconnection,
tagged queueing, and the host adapter's SCSI ID.
The global setting for the maximum number of tagged transactions allowed
per target is not honored as the CAM SCSI system will automatically determine
the maximum number of tags a device can receive as well as guarantee fair
resource allocation among devices.
