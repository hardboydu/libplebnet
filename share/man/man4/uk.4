.Nm device uk
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm uk
driver provides support for a 
process to address devices on the scsi bus for which there is no configured
driver. 
.Pp
In FreeBSD releases prior to 2.1, the first unknown device
found will be attached as
.Em uk0
and the next, 
.Em uk1
etc.
Beginning in 2.1 it is possible to specify what uk unit a device should
come on line as; refer to
.Xr scsi 4
for details on kernel configuration.
.Pp
A scsi adapter must also be separately configured into the system
before this driver makes sense.
.Pp
.Sh KERNEL CONFIGURATION
If an count is given that number of
.Nm 
devices will be configured into the kernel.

.Sh IOCTLS
The 
.Nm
driver has no ioctls of it's own but rather acts as a medium for the
generic 
.Xr scsi 4
ioctls. These are described in
.Em sys/scsiio.h.
