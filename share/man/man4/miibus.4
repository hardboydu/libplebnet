.Sh NAME
.Nm miibus
.Nd IEEE 802.3 Media Independent Interface network bus
.Sh SYNOPSIS
For most network interface cards (NIC):
.Cd "device miibus"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides an interconnection between the Media Access Control (MAC)
sublayer, the Physical Layer entities (PHY), Station Management (STA)
entities, and the PHY Layer as defined by the IEEE 802.3 Standard.
.Pp
The
.Nm
layer allows network device drivers to share common support
code for various external PHY devices.
Most 10/100 network interface cards either use an MII transceiver
or have built-in transceivers that can be programmed using an MII
interface.
The
.Nm
driver currently handles all of the media detection,
selection, and reporting using the ifmedia interface.
A generic driver has been included for all PHYs that are not
handled by a specific driver, this is possible because all
10/100 PHYs implement the same general register set along with
their vendor specific register set.
.Pp
The following network device drivers use the
.Nm
interface:

.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The implementation of
.Nm
was originally intended to have similar API interfaces
to
.Bxs 3.0
and
.Nx ,
but as a result are not well behaved newbus device drivers.
