.Dt RC 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rc
.Nd RISCom/8 multiport card
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device isa
.Cd device rc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn SDL
Communications
.Tn Riscom/8
boards.
The
.Tn RISCom/8
is an eight port
.Tn ISA
.Tn RS-232C
communications multiplexor with a built in
.Tn RISC
processor.
It uses a block of sixteen
.Tn I/O
ports in the range 0x200 to 0x3f0 selectable by on-board
switches or jumpers.
The block must be aligned on a sixteen port boundary.
The jumper-selectable hardware interrupt level may be set to
be detected during system
initialization using settings found in the
.Pa /boot/device.hints
file.
.Pp
This driver is mostly based on Cirrus Logic CL-CD180 driver.
.Sh ERRORS
The following driver specific error messages
may be reported:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBUSY
May be returned if the device was busy when a
request to access its resources was made by
.Nm
and was denied.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
May be returned if the
.Nm
driver was unable to obtain the
.Tn IOBASE
addresses.
.It Bq Er ENXIO
May be returned if the device cannot obtain a valid
.Tn IO
port through
.Fn isa_get_port .
This error may also be returned if the
.Fn isa_get_irq
function cannot obtain a valid
.Tn IRQ .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 2.0.5 .
This manual page first appeared in
.Fx 5.3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
This manual page was written by
.An Tom Rhodes Aq trhodes@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver code still uses the
.Fn splx
functions.
These should be replaced by
.Xr mutex 9
functions.
.Pp
The various
.Fn ttyld_*
functions should be documented.
