.Dt WATCHDOG 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm watchdog
.Nd Software watchdog
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd options WATCHDOG
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a set of checks and routines which allow the implementation of a software
watchdog solution.
.Pp
The user interface for
.Nm
is implemented via a trio of sysctl OIDs.
When
.Li debug.watchdog.enabled
is set to a positive value,
.Nm
timeout checks are performed.
In order to keep the watchdog from triggering,
.Li debug.watchdog.reset
must be accessed,
by reading or writing,
within every
.Li debug.watchdog.timeout
seconds.
Failure to keep the
.Nm
updated will result in the kernel outputting interrupt counts,
backtraces,
and then attempting to enter
.Xr ddb 9 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sysctl 8 ,
.Xr watchdogd 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
code first appeared in
.Fx 5.1 .

.Nm
code and manual page were written by
