.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a facility for controlling hardware and software watchdog facilities.
.Pp
The interface is through a device named "/dev/"
.Dv _PATH_WATCHDOG
which
responds to a single ioctl call,
.Dv WDIOCPATPAT .
.Pp
The ioctl call takes an argument which consists of a timeout value
specified as an integer power of two nanoseconds.
.Pp
The
.Dv WD_ACTIVE
flag signals that the watchdog will be kept from 
timing out from userland, for instance by the
.Xr watchdogd 8
daemon.
.Pp
To disable the watchdogs, use an argument of zero.
.Pp
The ioctl call will return success if just one of the available
watchdog implementations support the request.
If the ioctl fails, for instance if no watchdog supports the timeout
length, all watchdogs are disabled and must be explicitly reenabled.
