.Sh NAME
.Nm KAME
.Nd introduction and roadmap to KAME IPv6 software package
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm KAME
software package is a result of joint work of several IPv6 researchers
in Japan, to provide reference implementation of IPv6 to
Berkeley Software Distribution
.Pq BSD
derived system such as BSD/OS,
FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD
.Pq in alphabetical order .
.Pp
.\" Package consists of set of patches and additions to kernel,
.\" modification to application, daemons, header files and libraries.
KAME kit consists of IPv6/IPsec-ready kernel, application, daemons,
header files and libraries.
.\"
.Sh HIGHLIGHTS
Following are some of highlights of this implementation.

.Sh DOCUMENTATION
Although some of documentations have not modified yet, program itself
may be heavily modified.
Following lists are not complete, but give you some idea what kind of
new software modules are available, or, modifications are made.
Please refer to each manual page for detail.
Manpages are installed into
.Pa /usr/local/v6/man
so you may want to add the pathname to
.Dv MANPATH .
.\"
.Ss Installation and basic usage documentations
Please read following files in directory
.Pa /usr/local/v6/share/doc/kame
to get basic idea and installation methods on 
.Nm KAME :
.Pa README ,
.Pa RELNOTES ,
.Pa USAGE 
and
.Pa IMPLEMENTATION .
