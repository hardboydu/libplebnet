.Sh NAME
.Nm u3g
.Nd USB support for 3G datacards
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device u3g"
.Cd "device ucom"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
u3g_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the multiple USB-to-serial interfaces exposed by
many 3G USB/PCCard modems.
.Pp
The device is accessed through the
.Xr ucom 4
driver which makes it behave like a
.Xr tty 4 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following adapters:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact

Sierra cards
.El
.Pp
See
.Pa /sys/dev/u3g.c
for the complete list of supported cards for each vendor
mentioned above.
.Pp
The supported 3G cards provide the necessary modem port for ppp,
pppd, or mpd connections as well as extra ports (depending on the specific
device) to provide other functions (diagnostic port, SIM toolkit port).
.Pp
In some of these devices a mass storage device supported by the
.Xr umass 4
driver is present which contains Windows and Mac OS X drivers.
This device is
hidden, unless the machine was booted in verbose mode (see
.Xr boot 8 ) .
To temporarily unhide the device, set
.Va debug.bootverbose
to 1 using
.Xr sysctl 8
and replug the device.
The
.Xr u3gstub 4
device will attach temporarily and detach within seconds.

The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Fx 8.0 ,
is based on the
.Xr uark 4
driver, and written by
