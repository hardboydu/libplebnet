.Sh NAME
.Nm dcons
.Nd dumb console device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device dcons
.Pp
.Cd options DDB
.Cd options ALT_BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER
.Pp
.Cd device firewire
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device is the simple console device which just reads from and writes to
an allocated buffer for input and output respectivly.
It is no use by itself and it is supposed that the buffer is accessed
via a bus like
.Xr FireWire 4
or
.Xr kvm 3
for interaction.
.Pp
The buffer consists of 4 channels.
There are 2 ports, one for console tty and other is GDB ports then each port
has a input channel and a output channel.
.Sh EXAMPLE
If you want to run
.Xr getty 8
on dcons, insert following line into 
.Xr /etc/ttys 5
and
send a HUP signal to
.Xr init 8
using 
.Xr kill 1 .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dcons	"/usr/libexec/getty std.9600"	vt100	on  secure
.Ed
.Pp
Once
.Xr fwochi 4
device is initialized to allow physical access,
the buffer can be accessed from another host via FireWire bus using
.Xr dconschat 8
application. See
.Xr dconschat 8
for more details.
