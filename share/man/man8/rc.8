.Sh NAME
.Nm rc
.Nd command scripts for auto\-reboot and daemon startup
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rc
.Nm rc.conf
.Nm rc.conf.local
.Nm rc.serial
.Nm rc.pccard
.Nm rc.network
.Nm rc.firewall
.Nm rc.atm
.Nm rc.<arch>
.Nm rc.local
.Nm rc.shutdown
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Rc
is the command script which controls the automatic reboot
(calling the other scripts) and
.Nm rc.local
is the script holding commands which are pertinent only
to a specific site.  Typically, the /usr/local/etc/rc.d
mechanism is used instead of rc.local these days but if 
you do want to use rc.local, /etc/rc still supports it.
In this case, rc.local should source /etc/rc.conf and
contain additional custom startup code for your system.
.Nm Rc.conf
contains the global system configuration information referenced
by the rc files, while
.Nm rc.conf.local
contains the local system configuration.  See rc.conf(5)
.Pp
.Nm Rc.shutdown
is the command script which contains any necessary commands
to be executed as the system is shut down.
.Pp
When an automatic reboot is in progress,
.Nm rc
is invoked with the argument
.Em autoboot .
The first portion of
.Nm rc
runs an
.Xr fsck 8
with option
.Fl p
to ``preen'' all the disks of minor inconsistencies resulting
from the last system shutdown and to check for serious inconsistencies
caused by hardware or software failure.
If this auto-check and repair succeeds, then the second part of
.Nm rc
is run.
.Pp
The second part of
.Nm rc ,
which is run after an auto-reboot succeeds and also if
.Nm rc
is invoked when a single user shell terminates (see
.Xr init 8 ) ,
starts all the daemons on the system, preserves editor files
and clears the scratch directory
.Pa /tmp .
.Pp
.Nm Rc.serial
is used to set any special configurations for serial devices.
.Pp
.Nm Rc.pccard
is used to enable PC-cards.
.Pp
.Nm Rc.network
is used to start the network.
The network is started in three passes.
The first pass sets the hostname and domainname, configures the network
interfaces, turns on any IP firewall rules, and starts routing.
The second pass starts most of the network related daemons.
The third pass starts NFS, amd, rwhod, Kerberos and
the multicast routing daemon.
.Pp
.Nm Rc.firewall
is used to configure rules for the kernel based firewall
service. It has several possible options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "fBfilename" -compact -offset indent
.It open
will allow anyone in.
.It client
will try to protect just this machine.
.It simple
will try to protect a whole network.
.It closed
totally disables IP services except via lo0 interface.
.It UNKNOWN
disables the loading of firewall rules.
.It filename
will load the rules in the given filename (full path required).
.El
.Pp
.Nm Rc.atm
is used to configure ATM network interfaces.
The interfaces are configured in three passes.
The first pass performs the initial interface configuration.
The second pass completes the interface configuration and defines PVCs and
permanent ATMARP entries.
The third pass starts any ATM daemons.
.Pp
.Nm Rc.<arch>
runs architecture specific programs.
.Pp
.Nm Rc.local
is executed after the scripts above, but before the rest of the
.Nm rc
file is completed.
Presently, all
.Nm rc.local
does is to put version information in
.Pa /etc/motd .
.Pp
Following tradition, the startup files reside in
.Pa /etc .
