.Sh NAME
.Nm scsiformat
.Nd format SCSI disks and show SCSI parameters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm scsiformat
.Op Fl w
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl p Ar page-control
.Ar device-name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm scsiformat
utility can be used to format SCSI disks
on systems that support on-line SCSI formatting.
It will also show the various parameters set in the SCSI controller.
The
.Ar device-name
should be either a disk name like
.Ql sd0 ,
or the path name of the control device for a disk, as in
.Pa /dev/rsd0.ctl .
Using a regular disk device may not work, for example in case of a
device where the medium format is corrupted.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl p
Modify how the SCSI mode sense page query is constructed.
By default,
.Nm scsiformat
asks for the current settings.
The page-control flag is one of:
.sp
.Bl -tag -width XXX -compact
.It Li c
gets current settings.
.It Li d
gets default settings (those provided by the disk's manufacturer).
.It Li s
gets saved settings (those that persist across power cycles).
.It Li v
shows which parameters are variable.
.El
.It Fl w
Do actually format; by default, only the disk parameters will be
displayed.
.It Fl q
Quiet; suppress the mode page output.  Only the inquiry string will be
printed, so the operator can ensure he's going to format the intended
drive.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
These should mostly be self-explanatory.
A copy of the SCSI standard (or a more readable derivative)
may be useful, however.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr scsi 8 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm scsiformat
utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.
This version has been reworked as a wrapper around
.Xr scsi 8
by Peter Dufault for FreeBSD 2.1 .
