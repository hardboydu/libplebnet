.Sh NAME
.Nm cxconfig
.Nd channel options management utility for Cronyx-Sigma adapter
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
The 
.Nm
utility is used for configuring the channel options of
the Cronyx-Sigma adapter.
.Pp
To change channel options the channel should be free: the corresponding
network interface in ``down'' state, the asynchronous terminal device 
.Pa /dev/tty*
closed.
Generally, the channel options are set up during the operating
system startup, for example from the 
.Pa /etc/rc
file.
.Pp
Note, that not all options have a sense for every particular
case, and an attempt to set some of them can hang up the channel or
the whole adapter.
.Sh "Usage"
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It "cxconfig"
The brief information about all channels.
.It "cxconfig -a"
The full information about all channels.
.It "cxconfig <channel>"
The brief information about the channel.
.It "cxconfig -a <channel>"
The full information about the channel.
.It "cxconfig <channel> <option>..."
Setting the channel options.

.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It ispeed=#
Set the receiver baud rate to the number given.
The maximal value is 256000 bits/sec.
In the synchronous mode the receiver baud rate is significant
only when DPLL mode is used.
.It ospeed=#
Set the transmitter baud rate to the number given.
The maximal value is 256000 bits/sec.
In the synchronous mode the transmitter baud rate is significant
only in the case of the internal clock source.
If receiver and transmitter have equal data rate, then it could
be set by specifying only the numerical argument.
.It async
Set the asynchronous channel mode.
.It "hdlc, bisync, bsc, x.21, x21
Set the synchronous channel mode: HDLC, Bisync (BSC) or X.21.
.It ppp
Set the link-level protocol: PpP/HDLC.  The built-in simplified synchronous PPP
implementation is used (see RFC-1548, RFC-1549).
.It cisco
Set the link-level protocol: Cisco/HDLC (see RFC-1547).
This protocol is intended for compatibility with old models of Cisco routers,
and with early versions of BSD/386 drivers.
The extensive usage of this protocol is not recommended.
.It ext
Use the external link-level protocol suite (for BSD/386 only).
.It "+keepalive, -keepalive"
Enable the automatic line state control sub-protocol.
This setting is not significant when the external link-level protocol is used.
.It "+autorts, -autorts"
Enable the automatic RTS signal control.
When enabled, the RTS signal goes up only when both halves of
the receiver ring buffer are free and ready for receive,
and goes down when one or both buffers are busy.
.It "port=rs232, port=rs449, port=v35
Set the zero channel hardware interface type.
.El
.Sh "Common options"
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It "nrz, nrzi, manchester"
Set the data line signal encoding.
In the case of 
.Em NRZ
encoding the zero bit is transmitted by the zero signal
level, the one bit - by the positive signal level.
In the case of 
.Em NRZI
encoding the zero bit is transmitted by the change of
the signal level, the one bit - by the constant signal level.
In the case of 
.Em Manchester
encoding the zero bit is encoded as 01 value,
the one bit - as 10 value.
.It "+dpll, -dpll"
Enable the digital phase locked loop mode (DPLL).
When enabled, the receiver timing clock signal
is derived from the received data.
.It "+lloop, -lloop"
Set the local loopback mode.
.It "+extclock, -extclock"
Set the timing clock source of synchronous channels.  There are
two possible variants: 
.Em "external clock"
source or 
.Em "internal clock"
generation.
.Pp
.Em"External clock"
mode is the most common method for connecting
external modem hardware.  In this mode the external timing
signal is received on TXCIN pin of the connector, and it is
used as a synchronization clock for transmitting data (TXD).
.Pp
In the case of 
.Em "internal clock"
mode the transmitted data (TXD)
are synchronized using the internal on-board timing generator,
the internally generated timing signal is driven on the TXCOUT
pin, and the signal on the TXCIN pin is ignored.  This mode
is used for direct terminal-to-terminal communication,
e.g. for connecting two computers together in a synchronous mode
via relatively short cable.  This method should also be used
for testing channels with an external loopback connector.
.It fifo=#
FIFO threshold level setup for receiver and transmitter.
.It rfifo=#

.It "+ctsup, -ctsup"
Enable/disable interrupts on CTS (Clear To Send) signal setup (0 to 1 transition).
.It "+ctsdown, -ctsdown"
