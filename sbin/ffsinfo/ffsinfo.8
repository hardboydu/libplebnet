.Dt FSINFO 8
.Os BSD 4.4
.Sh NAME
.Nm ffsinfo
.Nd dump all meta information of an existing ufs file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ffsinfo
.Op Fl L
.Op Fl g Ar cylinder group
.Op Fl i Ar inode
.Op Fl l Ar level
.Op Fl o Ar outfile
.Ar < special | file >
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Ffsinfo
extends the 
.Xr dumpfs 8
program.
.Pp
The output is generated into the file
.Nm outfile .
Also expect the output file to be rather large. Up to 2 percent of the size
of the specified filesystem is not uncommon.
.Nm Ffsinfo
has some options to allow the defaults to be overridden.
.\".Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl L
Specifying this options skips the tests of the disklabel. This is automatically
done, if the specified filename to dump is a plain file.
.It Fl g Ar cylinder group
This restrictes the dump to infomation about this cylinder group only. Here
0 means the first cylinder group and -1 the last one.
.It Fl i Ar inode
This restrictes the dump to infomation about this particular inode only. Here 
the minimum acceptable inode is 2. If this option is omitted but a cylinder
group is defined then only inodes within that cylinder group are dumped.
.It Fl l Ar level
The level of detail which will be dumped.  This value defaults
to 255 and is the bitwise and of the following table:
.Bd -literal -offset left
0x001 - initial superblock
0x002 - superblock copys in each cylindergroup
0x004 - cylinder group summary in initial cylinder group
0x008 - cylinder group information
0x010 - inode allocation bitmap
0x020 - fragment allocation bitmap
0x040 - cluster maps and summary
0x080 - rotational layout tables
0x100 - inode information
0x200 - indirect block dump
.Ed
.It Fl o Ar outfile
This allows to change the output filename where the dump is written to. The
current default is
.Nm /var/tmp/ffsinfo .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
.Dl ffsinfo -l 1023 /dev/vinum/testvol
.Pp
will dump /dev/vinum/testvol with all available information.
.Sh BUGS
Currently
.Nm 
can only dump unmounted file systems. Do not try dumping a mounted file system,
your system may panic and you will not be able to use the file system any
longer.
.Pp
Also snapshots are handled like plain files. They should get a their own
level to provide for independent control of the amount of what gets dumped. It
probably also makes sense to some extend to dump the snapshot as a filesystem.
