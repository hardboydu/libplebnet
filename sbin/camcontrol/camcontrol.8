.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm camcontrol
is a utility designed to provide a way for users to access and control the
.Tn FreeBSD
CAM subsystem.
.Pp
.Nm camcontrol
can cause a loss of data and/or system crashes if used improperly.  Even
expert users are encouraged to excercise caution when using this command.
Novice users should stay away from this utility.
.Pp
.Nm camcontrol
has a number of primary functions, most of which take some generic
arguments:
.Bl -tag -width 01234567890123
.It Fl C Ar count
SCSI command retry count.  In order for this to work, error recovery
.Po
.Fl E
.Pc
must be turned on.
.It Fl E
Instruct the kernel to perform generic SCSI error recovery for the given
command.  This is needed in order for the retry count
.Po
.Fl C
.Pc
to be honored.  Other than retrying commands, the generic error recovery in
the code will generally attempt to spin up drives that are not spinning.
It may take some other actions, depending upon the sense code returned from
the command.
.It Fl n Ar dev_name
Specify the device type to operate on.  The default is
.Em da .
.It Fl t Ar timeout
SCSI command timeout in seconds.  This overrides the default timeout for
any given command.
.It Fl u Ar unit_number
Specify the device unit number.  The default is 0.
.It Fl v
Be verbose, print out sense information for failed SCSI commands.
.El
.Pp
Primay command functions:
.Bl -tag -width periphlist
.It devlist
List all physical devices (logical units) attached to the CAM subsystem.
This also includes a list of peripheral drivers attached to each device.
With the
.Fl v
argument, SCSI bus number, adapter name and unit numbers are printed as
well.
.It periphlist
List all peripheral drivers attached to a given physical device (logical
unit).
.It tur
Send the SCSI test unit ready (0x00) command to the given device.
.Nm camcontrol
will report whether the device is ready or not.
.It inquiry
Send a SCSI inquiry command (0x12) to a device.  By default,
.Nm camcontrol
will print out the standard inquiry data, device serial number, and
transfer rate information.  The user can specify that only certain types of
inquiry data be printed:
.Bl -tag -width 1234
.It Fl D
Get the standard inquiry data.
.It Fl S
Print out the serial number.  If this flag is the only one specified,
.Nm camcontrol
will not print out "Serial Number" before the value returned by the drive.
This is to aid in script writing.
.It Fl R
Print out transfer rate information.
.El
.It start
Send the SCSI Start/Stop Unit (0x1B) command to the given device with the
start bit set.
.It stop
Send the SCSI Start/Stop Unit (0x1B) command to the given device with the
start bit cleared.
.It eject
Send the SCSI Start/Stop Unit (0x1B) command to the given device with the
start bit cleared and the eject bit set.
.It rescan
Tell the kernel to scan the given bus (XPT_SCAN_BUS), or bus:target:lun
(XPT_SCAN_LUN) for new devices or devices that have gone away.  The user
may only specify a bus to scan, or a lun.  Scanning all luns on a target
isn't supported.
.It defects
Send the SCSI READ DEFECT DATA (10) command (0x37) to the given device, and
print out any combination of: the total number of defects, the primary
defect list (PLIST), and the grown defect list (GLIST).
.Bl -tag -width 01234567890
.It Fl f Ar format
The three format options are:
.Em block ,
to print out the list as logical blocks,
.Em bfi ,
to print out the list in bytes from index format, and
.Em phys ,
to print out the list in physical sector format.  The format argument is
required.  Most drives support the physical sector format.  Some drives
support the logical block format.  Many drives, if they don't support the
requested format, return the data in an alternate format, along with sense
information indicating that the requested data format isn't supported.
.Nm camcontrol
attempts to detect this, and print out whatever format the drive returns.
If the drive uses a non-standard sense code to report that it doesn't
support the requested format,
.Nm camcontrol
will probably see the error as a failure to complete the request.
.It Fl G
Print out the grown defect list.  This is a list of bad blocks that have
been remapped since the disk left the factory.
.It Fl P
Print out the primary defect list.
.El
.Pp
If neither
.Fl P
nor
.Fl G
is specified,
.Nm camcontrol
will print out the number of defects given in the READ DEFECT DATA header
returned from the drive.
.It modepage
Allows the user to display and optionally edit a SCSI mode page.  The mode
page formats are located in
.Pa /usr/share/misc/scsi_modes .
This can be overridden by specifying a different file in the
.Ev SCSI_MODES
environment variable.  The modepage command takes several arguments:
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901
.It Fl B
Disable block descriptors for mode sense.
.It Fl e
This flag allows the user to edit values in the mode page.
.It Fl m Ar mode_page
This specifies the number of the mode page the user would like to view
and/or edit.  This argument is mandatory.
.It Fl P page_ctl
This allows the user to specify the page control field.  Possible values are:
.Bl -tag -width xxx -compact
.It 1
Current values
.It 2
Changeable values
.It 3
Default values
.It 4
Saved values
.El
.El
.It cmd
Allows the user to send an arbitrary SCSI CDB to any device.  The cmd
function requires the
.Fl c
argument to specify the CDB.  Other arguments are optional, depending on
the command type.  The command and data specification syntax is documented
in
.Xr cam 3 .
NOTE:  If the CDB specified causes data to be transfered to or from the
SCSI device in question, you MUST specify either
.Fl i
or
.Fl o .
.Bl -tag -width 01234567890123456
.It Fl c Ar cmd Op args
This specifies the SCSI CDB.  CDBs may be 6, 10, 12 or 16 bytes.
.It Fl i Ar len Ar fmt
This specifies the amount of data to read, and how it should be displayed.
If the format is
.Sq - ,
.Ar len
bytes of data will be read from the device and written to standard output.
.It Fl o Ar len Ar fmt Op args
This specifies the amount of data to be written to a device, and the data
that is to be written.  If the format is
.Sq - ,
.Ar len
bytes of data will be read from standard input and written to the device.
.El
.It debug
Turn on CAM debugging printfs in the kernel.  This requires options CAMDEBUG 
in your kernel config file.  WARNING:  enabling debugging printfs currently
causes an EXTREME number of kernel printfs.  You may have difficulty
turning off the debugging printfs once they start, since the kernel will be
busy printing messages and unable to service other requests quickly.
The debug function takes a number of arguments:
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901234567
.It Fl I
Enable CAM_DEBUG_INFO printfs.
.It Fl T
Enable CAM_DEBUG_TRACE printfs.
.It Fl S
Enable CAM_DEBUG_SUBTRACE printfs.
.It all
Enable debugging for all devices.
.It off
Turn off debugging for all devices
.It bus Ns Op :target Ns Op :lun
Turn on debugging for the given bus, target or lun.  If the lun or target
and lun are not specified, they are wildcarded.  (i.e., just specifying a
bus turns on debugging printfs for all devices on that bus.)
.El
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Ev SCSI_MODES
variable allows the user to specify an alternate mode page format file.
.Pp
The
.Ev EDITOR
variable determines which text editor 
.Nm camcontrol
starts when editing mode pages.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/share/misc/scsi_modes -compact
.It Pa /usr/share/misc/scsi_modes
is the SCSI mode format database.
.It Pa /dev/xpt0 
is the transport layer device.
.It Pa /dev/pass*
are the CAM application passthrough devices.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl camcontrol eject -n cd -u 1 -v
.Pp
Eject the CD from cd1, and print SCSI sense information if the command
fails.
.Pp
.Dl camcontrol tur
.Pp
Send the SCSI test unit ready command to da0.
.Nm camcontrol
will report whether the disk is ready, but will not display sense
information if the command fails since the
.Fl v
switch was not specified.
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset foobar
camcontrol tur -n da -u 1 -E -C 4 -t 50 -v
.Ed
.Pp
Send a test unit ready command to da1.  Enable kernel error recovery.
Specify a retry count of 4, and a timeout of 50 seconds.  Enable sense
printing (with the
.Fl v
flag) if the command fails.  Since error recovery is turned on, the
disk will be spun up if it is not currently spinning.
.Nm camcontrol
will report whether or the disk is ready.
.Bd -literal -offset foobar
camcontrol cmd -n cd -u 1 -v -c "3C 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0e 00" \e
	-i 0xe "s1 i3 i1 i1 i1 i1 i1 i1 i1 i1 i1 i1"
.Ed
.Pp
Issue a READ BUFFER command (0x3C) to cd1.  Display the buffer size of cd1,
and display the first 10 bytes from the cache on cd1.  Display SCSI sense
information if the command fails.
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset foobar
camcontrol cmd -n cd -u u -v -c "3B 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0e 00" \e
	-o 14 "00 00 00 00 1 2 3 4 5 6 v v v v" 7 8 9 8
.Ed
.Pp
Issue a WRITE BUFFER (0x3B) command to cd1.  Write out 10 bytes of data,
not including the (reserved) 4 byte header.  Print out sense information if
the command fails.  Be very careful with this command, improper use may
cause data corruption.
.Pp
.Dl camcontrol modepage -n da -u 3 -m 1 -e -P 3
.Pp
Edit mode page 1 (the Read-Write Error Recover page) for da3, and save the
settings on the drive.  Mode page 1 contains a disk drive's auto read and
write reallocation settings, among other things.
.Pp
.Dl camcontrol rescan 0
.Pp
Rescan SCSI bus 0 for devices that have been added, removed or changed.
.Pp
.Dl camcontrol rescan 0:1:0
.Pp

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm camcontrol
command first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
.Pp
The mode page editing code and arbitrary SCSI command code are based upon
code in the old
.Xr scsi 8
utility and
.Xr scsi 3
library, written by Julian Ellischer and Peter Dufault.  The
.Xr scsi 8
first appeared in 386BSD 0.1.2.4, and first appeared in 
.Tn FreeBSD
in
.Fx 2.0.5 .

.Sh BUGS
Most of the man page cross references don't exist yet.  This will be fixed
soon.
.Pp
The code that parses the generic command line arguments doesn't know that
some of the subcommands take multiple arguments.  So if, for instance, you
tried something like this:
.Bd -literal -offset foobar
camcontrol -n da -u 1 -c "00 00 00 00 00 v" 0x00 -v
.Ed
.Pp
The sense information from the test unit ready command would not get
printed out, since the first
.Xr getopt 3
call in 
.Nm camcontrol
bails out when it sees the second argument to
.Fl c
.Po
0x00
.Pc ,
above.  Fixing this behavior would take some gross code, or changes to the
.Xr getopt 3
interface.  The best way to circumvent this problem is to always make sure
to specify generic
.Nm camcontrol
arguments before any command-specific arguments.
.Pp
It might be nice to add a way to allow users to specify devices by
bus/target/lun or by device string (e.g. "da1").
