.Sh NAME
.Nm mountd
.Nd service remote
.Tn NFS
mount requests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /sbin/mountd
.Op Fl nr
.Op Ar exportsfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Xr Mountd
is the server for
.Tn NFS
mount requests from other client machines.
.Xr Mountd
listens for service requests at the port indicated in the
.Tn NFS
server specification; see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC1094, Appendix A and
.%T "NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification" ,
Appendix I.
.Pp
Options and operands available for
.Nm mountd :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n
The
.Fl n
option allows non-root mount requests to be served.
This should only be specified if there are clients such as PC's,
that require it.
.It Fl r
The
.Fl r
option allows mount RPCs requests for regular files to be served.
Although this seems to violate the mount protocol specification, some diskless
workstations do mount requests for their swapfiles and expect them to be
regular files. Since a regular file cannot be specified in /etc/exports, the
entire file system that the swapfiles reside in will have to be exported with
the ``-alldirs'' flag.
.It Ar exportsfile
The
.Ar exportsfile
argument specifies an alternate location
for the exports file.
.El
.Pp
When mountd is started,
it loads the export host addresses and options into the kernel
using the mount(2) system call.
After changing the exports file,
a hangup signal should be sent to the mountd daemon
to get it to reload the export information.
After sending the SIGHUP
(kill -HUP `cat /var/run/mountd.pid`),
check the syslog output to see if mountd logged any parsing
errors in the exports file.
.Pp
If
.Nm mountd
detects that the running kernel does not include
.Tn NFS
support, it will attempt to load a loadable kernel module containing
.Tn NFS
code, using
.Xr modload 8
by way of
.Xr vfsload 3 .
If this fails, or no
.Tn NFS
LKM was available,
.Nm mountd
exits with an error.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/mountd.pid -compact
.It Pa /etc/exports
the list of exported filesystems
.It Pa /var/run/mountd.pid
the pid of the currently running mountd
.It Pa /var/db/mountdtab
the current list of remote mounted filesystems

.Sh HISTORY

.Nm mountd
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
