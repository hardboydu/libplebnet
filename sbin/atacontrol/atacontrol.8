.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a control program that provides the user access and control to the
.Fx 
ATA subsystem.
.Pp
.Nm
can cause severe system crashes and loss of data if used improperly, please
exercise caution when using this command!.
.Pp
.Nm
supports the following commands:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 8n
.It Ic attach 
Attach an ATA channel, devices on the channel are probed and attached as
is done on boot.
.Pp
.It Ic detach
Detach an ATA channel, devices on the channel are removed from the kernel,
and all outstanding tranfers etc are returned back to the system marked
as failed.
.Pp
.It Ic reinit
Reinitialize an ATA channel. Both devices on the channel are reset and
initialized to the parameters the ATA driver has stored internally.
Devices that has gone bad and no longer responds to the probe, or devices
that has physically been removed are removed from the kernel. Likewise
are devices that show up during a reset, probed and attached.
.Pp
.It Ic mode 
Without the two mode arguments the current transfer modes of both
devices are printed. If the mode arguments are given, the ATA driver
is asked to change the transfer modes to those given. The ATA driver
will reject modes that is not supported by the hardware.
Modes are given like PIO3, udma2, udma100, case does not matter.
.Pp
.It Ic info
Show info on the device on the channel, currently only the device
name and manufacture/version strings are shown.
