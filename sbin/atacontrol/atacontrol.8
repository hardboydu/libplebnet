.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a control program that provides the user access and control to the
.Fx
.Xr ata 4
subsystem.
.Pp
.Nm
can cause severe system crashes and loss of data if used improperly, please
exercise caution when using this command!
.Pp
The
.Ar channel
argument is the number of the ata channel on which to operate.
The following commands are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "attach"
.It Ic attach
Attach an ATA
.Ar channel ,
devices on the channel are probed and attached as
is done on boot.
.It Ic detach
Detach an ATA
.Ar channel ,
devices on the channel are removed from the kernel,
and all outstanding transfers etc. are returned back to the system marked
as failed.
.It Ic reinit
Reinitialize an ATA
.Ar channel .
Both devices on the channel are reset and
initialized to the parameters the ATA driver has stored internally.
Devices that has gone bad and no longer responds to the probe, or devices
that has physically been removed are removed from the kernel.
Likewise are devices that show up during a reset, probed and attached.
.It Ic rebuild
Rebuild a RAID1 array on a RAID capable ATA controller.
.It Ic mode
Without the two mode arguments the current transfer modes of both
devices are printed.
If the mode arguments are given, the ATA driver
is asked to change the transfer modes to those given.
The ATA driver
will reject modes that is not supported by the hardware.
Modes are given like
.Dq Li PIO3 ,
.Dq Li udma2 ,
.Dq Li udma100 ,
case does not matter.
If one of the devices mode should not be changed, use a nonexisting mode
as argument (i.e.\&
.Dq Li XXX ) ,
and the mode will remain unchanged.
.It Ic info
Show info about the attached devices on the
.Ar channel ,
currently only the device
name and manufacture/version strings are shown.
.It Ic list
Show info about all attached devices on all active controllers.
