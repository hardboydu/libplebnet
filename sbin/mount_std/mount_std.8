.Dt MOUNT_STD 8
.Os FreeBSD 2.2
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_std
.Nd mount ``standard'' filesystems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_ Ns Ar fsname
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Ar "devfs"
.Ar mount_point
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is a generic mechanism for attaching ``standard'' filesystems to
the filesystem.  A ``standard'' filesystem is one which:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
accepts only the standard
.Fl o
options
.Dq ro
.Pq ``rdonly'' ,
.Dq rw ,
.Dq nodev ,
.Dq noexec ,
.Dq nosuid ,
and
.Dq union .
.It
has a kernel filesystem module name the same as its user-visible name.
.It
requires no other special processing on the part of the
.Nm mount_std
command.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
command examines its zeroth command-line argument (the name by which
it was called) to determine the type of filesystem to be mounted.  If
it is called by a name which does not end in
.Dq Li _ Ns Ar fsname ,
.Nm
will issue a diagnostic and return an error.  The
.Nm
command is normally installed with appropriate links to commands for
the distributed filesystems which can be mounted in this way;
for information on the function of each filesystem, see the manual page
for that specific
.Nm mount_ Ns Ar fsname
command.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It argv[0] must end in _fsname
The
.Nm mount_std
command was called with a zero'th argument which does not specify a
filesystem type to be mounted.
.It vfsload(%s)
.Nm
was unable to load a kernel module implementing the %s filesystem
type.
.It %s filesystem not available
The specified filesystem type was not present in the kernel and no
loadable module for it was found.
