.Sh DESCRIPTION
If used as shown in the first synopsis line, the
.Ar file
will be read line by line and applied as arguments to the 
.Nm
command.
.Pp
The
.Nm
code works by going through the rule-list for each packet,
until a match is found.
All rules have two associated counters, a packet count and
a byte count.
These counters are updated when a packet matches the rule.
.Pp
The rules are ordered by a ``line-number'' from 1 to 65534 that is used
to order and delete rules. Rules are tried in increasing order, and the
first rule that matches a packet applies.
Multiple rules may share the same number and apply in
the order in which they were added.
.Pp
If a rule is added without a number, it numbered 100 higher
than the previous rule. If the highest defined rule number is
greater than 65434, new rules are appended to the last rule.
.Pp
The delete operation deletes the first rule with number
.Ar number ,
if any.
.Pp
The list command prints out the current rule set.
.Pp
The show command is equivalent to `ipfw -a list'.
.Pp
The zero operation zeroes the counters associated with rule number
.Ar number .
.Pp
The flush operation removes all rules.
.Pp
One rule is always present:
.Bd -literal -offset center
65535 deny all from any to any
.Ed
.Pp
This rule is the default policy, i.e., don't allow anything at all.
Your job in setting up rules is to modify this policy to match your
needs.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl a
While listing, show counter values. This option is the only way to see
accounting records.
.It Fl f
Don't ask for confirmation for commands that can cause problems if misused
(ie; flush).
.Ar Note ,
if there is no tty associated with the process, this is implied.
.It Fl q
While adding or flushing, be quiet about actions (implies '-f').  This is
useful for adjusting rules by executing multiple ipfw commands in a script
(e.g. sh /etc/rc.firewall), or by processing a file of many ipfw rules,
across a remote login session.  If a flush is performed in normal
(verbose) mode, it prints a message.  Because all rules are flushed, the
message cannot be delivered to the login session, the login session is
closed and the remainder of the ruleset is not processed.  Access to the
console is required to recover. 
.It Fl t
While listing, show last match timestamp.
.It Fl N
Try to resolve addresses and service names in output.
.El
.Pp
.Ar action :
.Bl -hang -offset flag -width 1234567890123456
.It Ar allow
Allow packets that match rule.
The search terminates.
.It Ar pass
Same as allow.
.It Ar accept
Same as allow.
.It Ar count
Update counters for all packets that match rule.
The search continues with the next rule.
.It Ar deny
Discard packets that match this rule.
The search terminates.
.It Ar reject
Discard packets that match this rule, and try to send an ICMP notice.
The search terminates.
.It Ar divert port
Divert packets that match this rule to the divert socket bound to port
.Ar port .
The search terminates.
.El
.Pp
When a packet matches a rule with the ``log''
keyword, a message will be printed on the console.
If the kernel was compiled with the
.Dv IP_FIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT
option, then logging will cease after the number of packets
specified by the option are received for that particular
chain entry.  Logging may then be re-enabled by clearing
the packet counter for that entry.
.Pp
.Ar proto :
.Bl -hang -offset flag -width 1234567890123456
.It Ar ip
All packets match.
.It Ar all
All packets match.
.It Ar tcp
Only TCP packets match.
.It Ar udp
Only UDP packets match.
.It Ar icmp
Only ICMP packets match.
.It Ar <number|name>
Only packets for the specified protocol matches (see
.Pa /etc/protocols
for a complete list).
.El
.Pp
.Ar src 
and
.Ar dst :
.Pp
.Bl -hang -offset flag
.It Ar <address/mask>
.Op Ar ports
.El
.Pp
The
.Em <address/mask>
may be specified as:
.Bl -hang -offset flag -width 1234567890123456
.It Ar ipno
An ipnumber of the form 1.2.3.4.
Only this exact ip number match the rule.
.It Ar ipno/bits
An ipnumber with a mask width of the form 1.2.3.4/24.
In this case all ip numbers from 1.2.3.0 to 1.2.3.255 will match.
.It Ar ipno:mask
An ipnumber with a mask width of the form 1.2.3.4:255.255.240.0.
In this case all ip numbers from 1.2.0.0 to 1.2.15.255 will match.
.El
.Pp
The sense of the match can be inverted by preceding an address with the
``not'' modifier, causing all other addresses to be matched instead. This
does not affect the selection of port numbers.
.Pp
With the TCP and UDP
.Em protocols ,
optional
.Em ports
may be specified as:
.Pp
.Bl -hang -offset flag
.It Ns {port|port-port} Ns Op ,port Ns Op ,...
.El
.Pp
Service names (from 
.Pa /etc/services )
may not be used instead of a numeric port value.
Also, note that a range may only be specified as the first value,
and the port list is limited to
.Dv IP_FW_MAX_PORTS
(as defined in 
.Pa /usr/src/sys/netinet/ip_fw.h )
ports.
.Pp
If ``via''
.Ar name
is specified, only packets received via or on their way out of an interface
matching
.Ar name
will match this rule.
.Pp
If ``via''
.Ar ipno
is specified, only packets received via or on their way out of an interface
having the address
.Ar ipno
will match this rule.
.Pp
.Ar options :
.Bl -hang -offset flag -width 1234567890123456
.It frag
Matches if the packet is a fragment and this is not the first fragment
of the datagram.
.It in
Matches if this packet was on the way in.
.It out
Matches if this packet was on the way out.
.It ipoptions Ar spec
Matches if the IP header contains the comma separated list of 
options specified in
.Ar spec .
The supported IP options are:
.Ar ssrr 
(strict source route),
.Ar lsrr 
(loose source route),
.Ar rr 
(record packet route), and
.Ar ts 
(timestamp).
The absence of a particular option may be denoted
with a ``!''.
.It established
Matches packets that have the RST or ACK bits set.
TCP packets only.
.It setup
Matches packets that have the SYN bit set but no ACK bit.
TCP packets only.
.It tcpflags Ar spec
Matches if the TCP header contains the comma separated list of
flags specified in
.Ar spec .
The supported TCP flags are:
.Ar fin ,
.Ar syn ,
.Ar rst ,
.Ar psh ,
.Ar ack ,
and
.Ar urg .
The absence of a particular flag may be denoted
with a ``!''.
.It icmptypes Ar types
Matches if the ICMP type is in the list
.Ar types .
The list may be specified as any combination of ranges
or individual types separated by commas.
.El
.Sh CHECKLIST
Here are some important points to consider when designing your
rules:
.Bl -bullet -hang -offset flag 
.It 
Remember that you filter both packets going in and out.
Most connections need packets going in both directions.
.It
Remember to test very carefully.
It is a good idea to be near the console when doing this.
.It
Don't forget the loopback interface.
.El
.Sh FINE POINTS
There is one kind of packet that the firewall will always discard,
that is an IP fragment with a fragment offset of one.
This is a valid packet, but it only has one use, to try to circumvent
firewalls.
.Pp
If you are logged in over a network, loading the LKM version of
.Nm
is probably not as straightforward as you would think.
I recommend this command line:
.Bd -literal -offset center
modload /lkm/ipfw_mod.o && \e
ipfw add 32000 allow all from any to any
.Ed
.Pp
Along the same lines, doing an
.Bd -literal -offset center
ipfw flush
.Ed
.Pp
in similar surroundings is also a bad idea.
.Sh PACKET DIVERSION
A divert socket bound to the specified port will receive all packets diverted
to that port; see
.Xr divert 4 .
If no socket is bound to the destination port, or if the kernel
wasn't compiled with divert socket support, diverted packets are dropped.
.Sh EXAMPLES
This command adds an entry which denies all tcp packets from
.Em hacker.evil.org
to the telnet port of
.Em wolf.tambov.su
from being forwarded by the host:
.Pp
.Dl ipfw add deny tcp from hacker.evil.org to wolf.tambov.su 23
.Pp 
This one disallows any connection from the entire hackers network to
my host:
.Pp
.Dl ipfw addf deny all from 123.45.67.0/24 to my.host.org
.Pp
Here is good usage of list command to see accounting records:
.Pp
.Dl ipfw -at l
.Pp
or in short form
.Pp
.Dl ipfw -a l
.Pp
This rule diverts all incoming packets from 192.168.2.0/24 to divert port 5000:
.Pp
.Dl ipfw divert 5000 all from 192.168.2.0/24 to any in

.Sh BUGS
.Pp
.Em WARNING!!WARNING!!WARNING!!WARNING!!WARNING!!WARNING!!WARNING!!
.Pp
This program can put your computer in rather unusable state. When
using it for the first time, work on the console of the computer, and
do
.Em NOT
do anything you don't understand.
.Pp
When manipulating/adding chain entries, service and protocol names are
not accepted.
