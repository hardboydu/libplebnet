$FreeBSD$

This is the part of the NgATM stuff that is shared by kernel and user.
Be careful to feed changes back to the maintainer <harti@freebsd.org>,
because the code here is actually shared with other environments besides
FreeBSD.

Import should be done by:

	cvs import \
		-m "Virgin import of NgATM shared kernel/user part X.Y" \
		src/sys/contrib/ngatm BEGEMOT NGATM_X_Y
