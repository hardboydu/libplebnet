.Sh NAME
.Nm loader.4th
.Nd loader.conf processing tools
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file that goes by the name of
.Nm
is a set of commands designed to manipulate
.Xr loader.conf 5
files. The default
.Pa /boot/loader.rc
includes
.Nm
and uses one of it's commands to automatically read and process
the standard
.Xr loader.conf 5
files. Other commands exists to help the user specify alternate
configurations.
.Pp
The commands of
.Nm
by themselves are not enough for most uses. Please refer to the
examples below for the most common situations, and to
.Xr loader 8
for additional commands.
.Pp
Before using any of the commands provided in
.Nm No ,
it must be included
through the command:
.Pp
.Dl include loader.4th
.Pp
This line is present on the default
.Pa /boot/loader.rc
file, so it isn't needed (and should not be re-issued) in a normal setup.
.Pp
The commands provided by it are:
.Bl -tag -width disable-module_module -offset indent
.It Ic boot-conf
Boot as specified by the
.Xr loader.conf 5
files read. It uses
.Ic autoboot ,
so it can be stopped.
.It Ic start
Reads
.Pa /boot/defaults/loader.conf ,
all other
.Xr loader.conf 5
files specified in it, and then proceeds to boot as specified in them. This
is command used on the default
.Pa /boot/loader.rc
file, and it uses the
.Pa autoboot
command (see
.Xr loader 8 ),
so it can be stopped for further interaction with
.Xr loader 8 .
.It Ic read-conf Ar filename
Reads and processes a
.Xr loader.conf 5
file. Does not proceeds to boot.
.It Ic enable-module Ar module
Enables the loading of
.Ar module .
.It Ic disable-module Ar module
Disables the loading of
.Ar module .
.It Ic toggle-module Ar module
Toggles the loading of
.Ar module
on and off.
.It Ic show-module Ar module
Shows the information gathered in the
.Xr loader.conf 5
files about the module
.Ar module .
.It Ic retry
Used inside
.Xr loader.conf 5
files to specify the action after a module loading fails.
.It Ic ignore
Used inside
.Xr loader.conf 5
files to specify the action after a module loading fails.
