NOTE ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO THE BOOTBLOCKS HERE.  The format of this
file is important.  Make sure the current version number is on line 6.

0.3:	Pass the physical address of the bootinfo block in register r8
	to the kernel. Continue to put it at the fixed address for now.
0.2:	Much improved version. Significant is the support for passing
	the FPSWA interface pointer to the kernel.
0.1:	Initial EFI version, germinated from the NetBSD i386
	standalone, but enormously modified.
