machine		ia64

# directive: cpu
# You must specify at least one CPU (the one you intend to run on). Deleting
# the support for CPUs you don't need to use may make parts of the system run
# faster. There's currently no special code for the different CPUs. Note also
# that the cpu declares the family. We may need to add support for specifying
# particular models.
cpu		ITANIUM
cpu		ITANIUM2

# option: IA32
# This option enables the support for execution of i386 (32-bit) programs on
# ia64. It is based on the ia32 emulation in the processor.
options		IA32

# option: LOG2_PAGE_SIZE
# Specify the log2 size of the page to be used for virtual memory management.
# The page size being equal to 1<<LOG2_PAGE_SIZE.
options		LOG2_PAGE_SIZE=14

# option: SKI
# Build support for running under the ski simulator.
options		SKI

# option: UWX_TRACE_ENABLE
