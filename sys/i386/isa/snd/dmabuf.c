SOUND OUTPUT

We use a circular buffer to store samples directed to the DAC.
The buffer is split into three variable-size regions, each identified
by an offset in the buffer (dp,rp,fp) and a lenght (dl,rl,fl).

      0          dp,dl        rp,rl         fp,fl    bufsize
      |__________|_____>______|_____________|________|
	  FREE        DMA          READY      FREE    

  READY region: contains data written from the process and ready
      to be sent to the DAC;

  FREE region: is the empty region of the buffer, where a process
      can write new data.

  DMA region: contains data being sent to the DAC by the DMA engine.
      the actual boundary between the FREE and READY regions is in
      fact within the DMA region (indicated by the > symbol above),
      and advances as the DMA engine makes progress.

Both the "READY" and "FREE" regions can wrap around the end of the
buffer. The "DMA" region can only wrap if AUTO DMA is used, otherwise
it cannot cross the end of the buffer.

Since dl can be updated on the fly, dl0 marks the value used when the
operation was started. When using AUTO DMA, bufsize-(count in the ISA DMA
register) directly reflects the position of dp.

At initialization, DMA and READY are empty, and FREE takes all the
available space:

    dp = rp = fp = 0 ;	--  beginning of buffer
    dl0 = dl = 0 ;	-- meaning no dma activity
    rl = 0 ;		-- meaning no data ready
    fl = bufsize ;

The DMA region is also empty whenever there is no DMA activity, for
whatever reason (e.g. no ready data, or output is paused).
The code works as follows: the user write routine dsp_write_body()
fills up the READY region with new data (reclaiming space from the
FREE region) and starts the write DMA engine if inactive (activity
is indicated by d->flags & SND_F_WR_DMA ). The size of each
DMA transfer is chosen according to a series of rules which will be
discussed later. When a DMA transfer is complete, an interrupt causes
dsp_wrintr() to be called which empties the DMA region, extends
the FREE region and possibly starts the next transfer.

In some cases, the code tries to track the current status of DMA
operations by calling isa_dmastatus() and advancing the boundary
between FREE and DMA regions accordingly.

The size of a DMA transfer is selected according to the following
rules:

  1. when not using AUTO DMA, do not wrap around the end of the
     buffer, and do not let fp move too close to the end of the
     buffer;

  2. do not use more than half of the buffer size.
     This serves to allow room for a next write operation concurrent
     with the dma transfer, and to reduce the time which is necessary
     to wait before a pending dma will end (optionally, the max
     size could be further limited to a fixed amount of play time,
     depending on number of channels, sample size and sample speed);

  3. use the current blocksize (either specified by the user, or
     corresponding roughly to 0.25s of data);

/*
 * SOUND INPUT
 *

The input part is similar to the output one. The only difference is in
the ordering of regions, which is the following:

      0          rp,rl        dp,dl         fp,fl    bufsize
      |__________|____________|______>______|________|
	  FREE       READY          DMA       FREE    

and the fact that input data are in the READY region.

At initialization, as for the write routine, DMA and READY are empty,
and FREE takes all the space:

    dp = rp = fp = 0 ;	-- beginning of buffer
    dl0 = dl = 0 ;	-- meaning no dma activity
    rl = 0 ;		-- meaning no data ready
    fl = bufsize ;

Operation is as follows: upon user read (dsp_read_body()) a DMA read
is started if not already active (marked by d->flags & SND_F_RD_DMA),
then as soon as data are available in the READY region they are
transferred to the user buffer, thus advancing the boundary between FREE
and READY. Upon interrupts, caused by a completion of a DMA transfer,
the READY region is extended and possibly a new transfer is started.

When necessary, isa_dmastatus() is called to advance the boundary
between READY and DMA to the real position.

The rules to choose the size of the new DMA area are similar to
the other case, i.e:

  1. if not using AUTO mode, do not wrap around the end of the
     buffer, and do not let fp move too close to the end of the
     buffer;

  2. do not use more than half the buffer size; this serves to
     leave room for the next dma operation.

  3. use the default blocksize, either user-specified, or
     corresponding to 0.25s of data;
