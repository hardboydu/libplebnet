In this file I will try to build a database of cards supported by this
driver. I also include the command to use for manual configuration of
the card in case your BIOS is not PnP-aware. Of course it is your
responsibility to pick up free prot ranges and irq and drq channels.

For PnP cards, I also include the vendor_id and serial numbers of
cards I have encountered. Underscores in the PnP id mean that there is
a large variety of values in those positions.

Finally, where available, I have put the URL where you can find the
data sheets of the chip.


CS4236: PnP id 0x36__630e
CS4237: PnP id 0x37__630e

	http://www.crystal.com/ 	4237full.pdf

    pnp 1 0 os enable port0 0x534 port2 0x220 irq0 5 drq0 1 drq1 3

    work like a charm. All modes, including full duplex, supported in
    MSS mode.

    NOTE: cards based on the 4237, and possibly the 4236 as well,
        connect the CD to AUX2. When used in MODE1/2 (as this driver
	does) there is no route in the input mixer from AUX2 to the
	ADC. So, to record directly from the CD, the only way is
	to set the input to SOUND_MASK_IMIX.

CS4232: PnP id 0x3242630e

    pnp 1 0 os enable port0 0x534 port2 0x220 irq0 5 drq0 1 drq1 3

    This chip is reported as broken in the OSS documentation. As a
    matter of fact, on my Intel Zappa motherboard, I have problems in
    make it use the secondary DMA channel. I have it working in
    half duplex (both capture and playback) in SB3.2 emulation,
    and working in playback mode in MSS emulation.
    Also have reports from some user that it works ok.

OPTi931: PnP id 0x3109143e

	http://www.opti.com/  opti931_21.pdf

    pnp 1 1 os enable port0 0x534 port2 0x220 port3 0xe0d irq0 10 drq0 1 drq1 6

    The data sheets of this chip are very cryptic and do not match
    what the cards I have seem to do. I have it working
    in WSS emulation, in full duplex and all modes.
    In SB emulation mode the driver does not work yet (maybe I do
    not initialize it the right way). It is not a major concern
    anyways.
    I am strongly convinced of a couple of bugs in the chip. I have
    sent email to OPTI but got no reply so far. The bugs are:
    - you cannot set both playback and capture format to use
      a companded mode (ULAW, ALAW). If you do, the card will screw
      up on the capture section.
      The driver has a partial fix in software: when using ULAW, it
      programs ULAW on the playback section, U8 on the capture, and
      does a conversion in software (much like the SBPro). Of course
      you lose 4-5 bits of dynamic range in the process.
    - in full duplex (and single DMA mode), the card occasionally
      misses interrupts, or generates spurious ones. Spurious ints are
      not problematic since they can be ignored, but missed ones are
      as you can imagine... This is fixed by auto-dma mode.

SB16 PnP: PnP id 0x__008c0e

	http://www.creative.com sbhwpg.pdf or SBHWPG.EXE

    pnp 1 0 os enable port0 0x220 irq0 5 drq0 1 drq1 5

    There are many such cards (plain SB16 PnP, AWE32, AWE64, Vibra16,
    etc.) all differing in the PnP id. They have different synthesis
    devices, which we do not support, so we are not affected by these
    differences. Don't worry if the driver identifies the card as a
    different SB16 than the one you have.

    Full duplex support of this card is tricky since one channel can
    work in 16-bit and the other in 8-bit mode. You will need to use
    the new set of ioctl to use separate data formats on the two
    channels (the vat driver does this). Of course, quality in 8-bit
    is much lower than in 16-bit.

    Full duplex operation is unsupported by Creative. It seems to
    work, although on my Vibra16 the command to stop DMA transfer
    seems to erroneously affect both channels instead of the one
    they are issued for. The driver has a workaround, but I cannot
    guarantee that it works for everybody. I have had several
    positive reports.

    Some docs on how to use this card with the voxware driver
    are at http://multiverse.com/~rhh/awedrv

    NOTE: 980122 I have had a couple of reports from people using
    the Vibra16X (and clones, e.g. based on the Avance Logic
    chipsets) which appears to use two 8-bit DMA channels.  It
    might be possible that new SB16 are able to do true full duplex!
    The driver _does not_ support these boards although the fix
    should be relatively easy.

ASound:
    Avance Logic makes SB clones, and apparently documentation
    is available at

	http://www.realtek.com.tw/cp/cp.html

    these card should be recognised as SB16 clones.

Yamaha SA2/SA3

	http://www.yamaha.com ? YM711.pdf
    (this is a huge file containing a few pages scanned and converted
    to pdf. Not very useful or detailed.)

    pnp 1 0 os enable port0 0x220 port1 0x530 irq0 5 drq0 1 drq1 5

    this card emulates a WSS or SB. Have reports that it works, although
    it has incomplete mixer support (Yamaha defines an additional set
    of registers to control some mixer functions, such as the master
    output volume). Currently we set the master volume to 100%.
    Driver reported to work also on Toshiba DynaBook Portege 300CT
    with OPL3SA-3(non-PNP)

Ensoniq Soundscape VIVO

    pnp 1 0 os enable port0 0x220 port1 0x530 irq0 5 drq0 1 drq1 5

    this card emulates a WSS or SB. Have reports that it works.

GusPnP: PnP id 0x0100561e

    pnp 1 0 os enable port0 0x220 port1 0x320 port2 0x32c irq0 5 drq0 7 drq1 5

    It works in U8 and S16 mode, ulaw support still not working.


NOT WORKING YET:

OPTI925: PnP id 0x2509143e

    there is code to recognize it as a SB clone. I have reports that
    it probes ok, but not sure if it works.

OPTI924: PnP

    I have this card but it is still unsupported.

OPTI930:

    should work as an MSS clone, but support for it is not implemented
    yet.

ESS1868
ESS688

	http://www.esstech.com

    pnp 1 1 os enable irq0 7 drq0 1 port1 0x220

    There used to be documentation for the 1868 on the ESS site
    (files ds1868b1.pdf and ds1868b2.pdf) but I am unable to find
    it now (980122). I have asked ESS but no reply so far.

    partly supported in SB emulation.

    (the ESS688 is used on many notebooks. It is probably able to do 8
    and 16-bit, half duplex).

PCI cards:

    some vendors have PCI cards. This code _cannot_ work on these
    cards as it is now, since they cannot obviously use the ISA DMA
    controller. As there are no data sheets available for these PCI
    cards, none of them is supported at the moment, although support
    should be easy as soon as I can put my hands on the data sheets
    and cards.
