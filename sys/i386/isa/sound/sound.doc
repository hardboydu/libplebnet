Instructions on using audio on a FreeBSD 2.1 (or 2.0-current) system.
See also /sys/i386/conf/LINT.

To enable sound driver support, the controller sound code must be included
in your config file:

# SB = SoundBlaster;  PAS = ProAudioSpectrum;  GUS = Gravis UltraSound
# Controls all sound devices
controller	snd0

Uncomment one or more of these device entries, depending on what type of
sound card you have:

# SoundBlaster DSP driver - for SB, SB Pro, SB16, PAS(emulating SB)
#device sb0      at isa? port 0x220 irq 7 drq 1 vector sbintr

# SoundBlaster 16 DSP driver - for SB16 - requires sb0 device
#device sbxvi0   at isa? drq 5

# SoundBlaster 16 MIDI - for SB16 - requires sb0 device
#device sbmidi0  at isa? port 0x300

# ProAudioSpectrum PCM and Midi - for PAS
#device pas0     at isa? port 0x388 irq 10 drq 6 vector pasintr

# Gravis UltraSound - for GUS, GUS16, GUSMAX
#device gus0 at isa? port 0x220 irq 11 drq 1 vector gusintr

# Gravis UltraSound 16 bit option - for GUS16 - requires gus0
#device gusxvi0 at isa? port 0x530 irq 7 drq 3 vector adintr

# Gravis UltraSound MAX - for GUSMAX - requires gus0
#device gusmax0 at isa? port 0x32c

# MS Sound System
#device mss0 at isa? port 0x530 irq 10 drq 1 vector adintr

# Yamaha OPL-2/OPL-3 FM - for SB, SB Pro, SB16, PAS
#device opl0     at isa? port 0x388

# MPU-401 - for MPU-401 standalone card
#device mpu0     at isa? port 0x330 irq 6 drq 0

# 6850 UART Midi
#device uart0 at isa? port 0x330 irq 5 vector "m6850intr"

You may add one or more of the following depending on what you do and don't
want compiled into your kernel.  Note:  Excluding things with EXCLUDE_... 
is NOT recommended unless you really know what you're doing.

#options 	EXCLUDE_AUDIO			# NO digital audio support
#options 	EXCLUDE_SEQUENCER		# NO sequencer support
#options	EXCLUDE_MIDI			# NO MIDI support whatsoever
#options 	EXCLUDE_SBPRO			# EXCLUDE SB Pro support
#options 	EXCLUDE_SB_EMULATION		# NO PAS SB emulation support
#options 	EXCLUDE_GUS_IODETECT		# NO GUS io detection
#options 	EXCLUDE_PRO_MIDI		# NO PAS MIDI support

NOTE:  The MPU-401 driver may or may not work, and is unfortunately
unverifiable since no one I know has one.  If you can test this,
please let me know!  Also note that you will have to change these
settings if your soundcard is set for a non-standard address or IRQ.
Please check your documentation (or verify with any provided DOS utilities
that may have come with your card) and set the IRQ or address fields
accordingly.

Also:  Some systems with the OPTI chipset will require you to #define
BROKEN_BUS_CLOCK in /sys/i386/sound/pas2_card.c.  Symptoms are that
you will hear a lot of clicking and popping sounds, like a geiger counter,
coming out of the PAS even when is not playing anything.

Also:  You can configure more then one card on a single DMA using 
ALLOW_CONFLICT_DMA.

Probing problems:  Since the SB16 uses the same IRQ and addresses for
the different drivers, some of the snd dirvers will not be probed because
the kernel thinks there is a conflict.  This can be worked-around by
setting the ALLOW_CONFLICT_IOADDR or ALLOW_CONFLICT_IRQ options.

Warning: Setting the ALLOW_* options will will bypass checks for ALL drivers,
so be careful when you use them!
