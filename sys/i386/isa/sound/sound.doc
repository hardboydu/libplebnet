Instructions on using audio on a FreeBSD 2.1 (or 2.0-current) system.
See also /sys/i386/conf/LINT.

You may add one or more of the following depending on what you do and don't
want compiled into your kernel.  Note:  Excluding things with EXCLUDE_... 
is NOT recommended unless you really know what you're doing.

      options         "AUDIO_MPU401"          # INCLUDE MPU401 support
      options         AUDIO_GUS               # INCLUDE GUS support
      options         AUDIO_SBPRO             # INCLUDE SB Pro support
      options         "AUDIO_SB16"            # INCLUDE SB 16 support
      options         "AUDIO_YM3812"          # INCLUDE AdLib support
      options         AUDIO_PAS               # INCLUDE Pro Audio Studio support
      options         AUDIO_SB                # INCLUDE SB support
      options         AUDIO_MSS               # INCLUDE MSS support
      options         EXCLUDE_AUDIO           # NO digital audio support
      options         EXCLUDE_SEQUENCER       # NO sequencer support
      options         EXCLUDE_GUS_IODETECT    # NO GUS io detection
      options         EXCLUDE_SB_EMULATION    # NO PAS SB emulation support
      options         "EXCLUDE_OPL3"          # NO OPL3 chip support
      options         EXCLUDE_PRO_MIDI        # NO PAS MIDI support
      options         EXCLUDE_CHIP_MIDI       # NO MIDI chip support
      options	      EXCLUDE_MIDI	      # NO MIDI support whatsoever

To enable sound card support, you need to uncomment and add one or more of 
the following lines to your kernel configuration file according to the
directions below:

#device snd5 at isa? port 0x330 irq 6 vector mpuintr
#device snd4 at isa? port 0x220 irq 15 drq 6 vector gusintr
#device snd3 at isa? port 0x388 irq 10 drq 6 vector pasintr
#device snd2 at isa? port 0x220 irq 7 drq 1 vector sbintr
#device snd6 at isa? port 0x220 irq 7 drq 5 vector sbintr
#device snd10 at isa? port 0x530 irq 10 drq 1 vector adintr
#device snd7 at isa? port 0x300
#device snd1 at isa? port 0x388

Note for PAS user: you should change snd1 line to
#device snd1 at isa? port 0x38a
(next stereo port) to avoid conflict with snd3

       Unit numbers are:
                 1 for Yamaha FM synth
                 2 for SB/SB Pro DSP
                 3 for PAS PCM and Midi
                 4 for GUS
                 5 for MPU-401 (there is separate driver for the SB16)
                 6 for SB16 (DSP)
                 7 for SB16 Midi (MPU-401 emulation)
                 10 for Microsoft Windows Sound System (AD1846)

       If you have ProAudioSpectrum, uncomment units 3, 2 and 1
       If you have SoundBlaster 1.0 to 2.0 or SB Pro, uncomment 2 and 1.
       If you have SoundBlaster 16, uncomment 2, 1, 6 and 7.
       (use the same IRQ for the cards 2, 6 and 7. The DMA of the
       card 2 is the 8 bit one and the DMA of the card 6 is the 16 bit one.
       the port address of the card 7 is the Midi I/O address of the SB16.
       If you have GravisUltrasound, uncomment 4
       If you have MPU-401, uncomment 5

NOTE:  The MPU-401 driver may or may not work, and is unfortunately
unverifiable since no one I know has one.  If you can test this,
please let me know!  Also note that you will have to change these
settings if your soundcard is set for a non-standard address or IRQ.
Please check your documentation (or verify with any provided DOS utilities
that may have come with your card) and set the IRQ or address fields
accordingly.

Also:  Some systems with the OPTI chipset will require you to #define
BROKEN_BUS_CLOCK in /sys/i386/sound/pas2_card.c.  Symptoms are that
you will hear a lot of clicking and popping sounds, like a geiger counter,
coming out of the PAS even when is not playing anything.

Also:  You can configure more then one card on a single DMA using 
ALLOW_CONFLICT_DMA.

Probing problems:  Since the SB16 uses the same IRQ and addresses for
the different drivers, some of the snd dirvers will not be probed because
the kernel thinks there is a conflict.  This can be worked-around by
setting the ALLOW_CONFLICT_IOADDR or ALLOW_CONFLICT_IRQ options.

Warning: Setting the ALLOW_* options will will bypass checks for ALL drivers,
so be careful when you use them!
