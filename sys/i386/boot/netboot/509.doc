During adding of 3C509 support I made following changes:

1) File if_epreg.h added - it is slightly different from one in
/usr/src/sys/i386/isa !

2) Support of 3C509 added to ether.c

3) Flag -DINCLUDE_3C509 added (to ether.h, ether.c, Makefile)

4) Routine eth_fillname() added to ether.c because 3C509 has
different driver (ep0 instead of ed0). Main.c was changed
according to this.

I had tested this version with 3C509 only, but I see no reasons
why it must not work with other cards.

But don't try to link it for both 3C509 and 8390-based cards. In
this case object file grows behind 16K and everything fails
to work. I don't know how correct this trouble.
