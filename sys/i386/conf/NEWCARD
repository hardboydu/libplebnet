# NEWCARD -- efforts at porting newconfig pccard/cardbus code to newbus
#
# This is a new implementation of pccard and cardbus support.  It works
# for many folks right now.  Some folks still have issues.  The support
# around the edges isn't as complete as the previous pccard system.
#
# For more information on this file, please read the handbook section on
# Kernel Configuration Files:
#
#    http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig-config.html
#
# The handbook is also available locally in /usr/share/doc/handbook
# if you've installed the doc distribution, otherwise always see the
# FreeBSD World Wide Web server (http://www.FreeBSD.org/) for the
# latest information.
#
# An exhaustive list of options and more detailed explanations of the
# device lines is also present in the NOTES configuration file. If you are
# in doubt as to the purpose or necessity of a line, check first in NOTES.
