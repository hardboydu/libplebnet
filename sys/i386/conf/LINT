# SCSI DEVICES

# SCSI DEVICE CONFIGURATION

# The SCSI subsystem consists of the `base' SCSI code, a number of
# high-level SCSI device `type' drivers, and the low-level host-adapter
# device drivers.  The host adapters are listed in the ISA and PCI
# device configuration sections below.
#
# Beginning with FreeBSD 2.0.5 you can wire down your SCSI devices so
# that a given bus, target, and LUN always come on line as the same
# device unit.  In earlier versions the unit numbers were assigned
# in the order that the devices were probed on the SCSI bus.  This
# means that if you removed a disk drive, you may have had to rewrite
# your /etc/fstab file, and also that you had to be careful when adding
# a new disk as it may have been probed earlier and moved your device
# configuration around.

# This old behavior is maintained as the default behavior.  The unit
# assignment begins with the first non-wired down unit for a device
# type.  For example, if you wire a disk as "da3" then the first
# non-wired disk will be assigned da4.

# The syntax for wiring down devices is:

# device	scbus0 at ahc0		# Single bus device
# device	scbus1 at ahc1 bus 0	# Single bus device
# device	scbus3 at ahc2 bus 0	# Twin bus device
# device	scbus2 at ahc2 bus 1	# Twin bus device
# device 	da0 at scbus0 target 0 unit 0
# device	da1 at scbus3 target 1
# device	da2 at scbus2 target 3
# device	sa1 at scbus1 target 6
# device	cd0 at scbus?

# "units" (SCSI logical unit number) that are not specified are
# treated as if specified as LUN 0.

# All SCSI devices allocate as many units as are required.

# The "unknown" device (uk? in pre-2.0.5) is now part of the base SCSI
# configuration and doesn't have to be explicitly configured.

# HARDWARE DEVICE CONFIGURATION

# ISA and EISA devices:
# EISA support is available for some device, so they can be auto-probed.
# Micro Channel is not supported at all.

#
# Mandatory ISA devices: isa, npx
#
device		isa0

#
# Options for `isa':
#
# AUTO_EOI_1 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the master 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# This option breaks suspend/resume on some portables.
#
# AUTO_EOI_2 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the slave 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# Automatic EOI is documented not to work for for the slave with the
# original i8259A, but it works for some clones and some integrated
# versions.
#
# MAXMEM specifies the amount of RAM on the machine; if this is not
# specified, FreeBSD will first read the amount of memory from the CMOS
# RAM, so the amount of memory will initially be limited to 64MB or 16MB
# depending on the BIOS.  If the BIOS reports 64MB, a memory probe will
# then attempt to detect the installed amount of RAM.  If this probe
# fails to detect >64MB RAM you will have to use the MAXMEM option.
# The amount is in kilobytes, so for a machine with 128MB of RAM, it would
# be 131072 (128 * 1024).
#
# BROKEN_KEYBOARD_RESET disables the use of the keyboard controller to
# reset the CPU for reboot.  This is needed on some systems with broken
# keyboard controllers.

# The Numeric Processing eXtension driver.  In addition to this, you

#	0x04	don't use the npx registers to optimize copyin or copyout.
#	0x08	use emulator even if hardware FPU is available.
# The npx registers are normally used to optimize copying and zeroing when
# all of the following conditions are satisfied:
#	I586_CPU is an option
#	the cpu is an i586 (perhaps not a Pentium)
#	the probe for npx0 succeeds
#	INT 16 exception handling works.
# Then copying and zeroing using the npx registers is normally 30-100% faster.
# The flags can be used to control cases where it doesn't work or is slower.
# Setting them at boot time using userconfig works right (the optimizations
# are not used until later in the bootstrap when npx0 is attached).

# ATA_ENABLE_ATAPI_DMA:	enable DMA on ATAPI device, since many ATAPI devices
#			claim to support DMA but doesn't actually work, this
#			is not enabled as default.
# ATA_16BIT_ONLY:	for older HW that doesn't support 32bit transfers on
#			the ATA channels (mostly old ISA boards).

options 	ATA_STATIC_ID

#device		ata1	at isa? port IO_WD2 irq 15

#
# ST-506, ESDI, and IDE hard disks: `wdc' and `wd'
#
# The flags fields are used to enable the multi-sector I/O and
# the 32BIT I/O modes.  The flags may be used in either the controller
# definition or in the individual disk definitions.  The controller
# definition is supported for the boot configuration stuff.
#
# Each drive has a 16 bit flags value defined:
#	The low 8 bits are the maximum value for the multi-sector I/O,
#	where 0xff defaults to the maximum that the drive can handle.
#	The high bit of the 16 bit flags (0x8000) allows probing for
#	32 bit transfers.  Bit 14 (0x4000) enables a hack to wake
#	up powered-down laptop drives.  Bit 13 (0x2000) allows
#	probing for PCI IDE DMA controllers, such as Intel's PIIX
#	south bridges. Bit 12 (0x1000) sets LBA mode instead of the
#	default CHS mode for accessing the drive. See the wd.4 man page.
#
# The flags field for the drives can be specified in the controller
# specification with the low 16 bits for drive 0, and the high 16 bits
# for drive 1.
# e.g.:
#device		wdc0	at isa? port IO_WD1 irq 14 flags 0x00ff8004
#
# specifies that drive 0 will be allowed to probe for 32 bit transfers and
# a maximum multi-sector transfer of 4 sectors, and drive 1 will not be
# allowed to probe for 32 bit transfers, but will allow multi-sector
# transfers up to the maximum that the drive supports.
#
# If you are using a PCI controller that is not running in compatibility
# mode (for example, it is a 2nd IDE PCI interface), then use config line(s)
# such as:
#
#device		wdc2	at isa? port 0 irq ? flags 0xa0ffa0ff
#device		wd4	at wdc2 drive 0
#device		wd5	at wdc2 drive 1
#
#device		wdc3	at isa? port 0 irq ? flags 0xa0ffa0ff
#device		wd6	at wdc3 drive 0
#device		wd7	at wdc3 drive 1
#
# Note that the above config would be useful for a Promise card, when used
# on a MB that already has a PIIX controller.  Note the bogus irq and port
# entries.  These are automatically filled in by the IDE/PCI support.
#
# This driver must be commented out because it is mutually exclusive with

#  The flags takes the following meaning for apm0:
#    0x0020  Statclock is broken.
#  If apm is omitted, some systems require sysctl -w kern.timecounter.method=1
#  for correct timekeeping.

# Notes on the spigot:
#  The video spigot is at 0xad6.  This port address can not be changed.
#  The irq values may only be 10, 11, or 15
#  I/O memory is an 8kb region.  Possible values are:
#    0a0000, 0a2000, ..., 0fffff, f00000, f02000, ..., ffffff
#    The start address must be on an even boundary.
#  Add the following option if you want to allow non-root users to be able
#  to access the spigot.  This option is not secure because it allows users
#  direct access to the I/O page.
#  	options SPIGOT_UNSECURE

# Notes on the Comtrol Rocketport driver:
#
# The exact values used for rp0 depend on how many boards you have
# in the system.  The manufacturer's sample configs are listed as:
#
#   Comtrol Rocketport ISA single card
#               device  rp0     at isa? port 0x280
#
#   If instead you have two ISA cards, one installed at 0x100 and the
#   second installed at 0x180, then you should add the following to
#   your kernel configuration file:
#
#               device  rp0     at isa? port 0x100
#               device  rp1     at isa? port 0x180
#
#   For 4 ISA cards, it might be something like this:
#
#               device  rp0     at isa? port 0x180
#               device  rp1     at isa? port 0x100
#               device  rp2     at isa? port 0x340
#               device  rp3     at isa? port 0x240
#
#   And for PCI cards, you only need say:
#
#               device rp0
#               device rp1
#               ...
#   Note: Make sure that any Rocketport PCI devices are specified BEFORE the
#   ISA Rocketport devices.

# Notes on the Digiboard driver:
#
# The following flag values have special meanings:
#	0x01 - alternate layout of pins (dgb & dgm)
#	0x02 - use the windowed PC/Xe in 64K mode (dgb only)

# Notes on the Specialix SI/XIO driver:
#  **This is NOT a Specialix supported Driver!**
#  The host card is memory, not IO mapped.
#  The Rev 1 host cards use a 64K chunk, on a 32K boundary.
#  The Rev 2 host cards use a 32K chunk, on a 32K boundary.
#  The cards can use an IRQ of 11, 12 or 15.

# Notes on the Stallion stl and stli drivers:
#  See src/i386/isa/README.stl for complete instructions.
#  This is version 0.0.5alpha, unsupported by Stallion.
#  The stl driver has a secondary IO port hard coded at 0x280.  You need
#     to change src/i386/isa/stallion.c if you reconfigure this on the boards.
#  The "flags" and "iosiz" settings on the stli driver depend on the board:
#	EasyConnection 8/64 ISA:     flags 23         iosiz 0x1000
#	EasyConnection 8/64 EISA:    flags 24         iosiz 0x10000
#	EasyConnection 8/64 MCA:     flags 25         iosiz 0x1000
#	ONboard ISA:                 flags 4          iosiz 0x10000
#	ONboard EISA:                flags 7          iosiz 0x10000
#	ONboard MCA:                 flags 3          iosiz 0x10000
#	Brumby:                      flags 2          iosiz 0x4000

# specifies COMPAT_SVR4.  It is possible to have a statically-configured 
# STREAMS device and a dynamically loadable svr4 emulator;  the /usr/sbin/svr4
# script understands that it doesn't need to load the `streams' module under
# those circumstances.

# The 'dpt' driver provides support for DPT controllers (http://www.dpt.com/).
# These have hardware RAID-{0,1,5} support, and do multi-initiator I/O.
# The DPT controllers are commonly re-licensed under other brand-names -
# some controllers by Olivetti, Dec, HP, AT&T, SNI, AST, Alphatronic, NEC and
# Compaq are actually DPT controllers.
#
# See src/sys/dev/dpt for debugging and other subtle options.
#   DPT_MEASURE_PERFORMANCE Enables a set of (semi)invasive metrics. Various
#                           instruments are enabled.  The tools in
#                           /usr/sbin/dpt_* assume these to be enabled.
#   DPT_HANDLE_TIMEOUTS     Normally device timeouts are handled by the DPT.
#                           If you ant the driver to handle timeouts, enable
#                           this option.  If your system is very busy, this
#                           option will create more trouble than solve.
#   DPT_TIMEOUT_FACTOR      Used to compute the excessive amount of time to
#                           wait when timing out with the above option.
#  DPT_DEBUG_xxxx           These are controllable from sys/dev/dpt/dpt.h
#  DPT_LOST_IRQ             When enabled, will try, once per second, to catch
#                           any interrupt that got lost.  Seems to help in some
#                           DPT-firmware/Motherboard combinations.  Minimal
#                           cost, great benefit.
#  DPT_RESET_HBA            Make "reset" actually reset the controller
#                           instead of fudging it.  Only enable this if you
#			    are 100% certain you need it.
