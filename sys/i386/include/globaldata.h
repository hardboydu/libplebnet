 * This structure maps out the global data that needs to be kept on a
 * per-cpu basis.  genassym uses this to generate offsets for the assembler
 * code, which also provides external symbols so that C can get at them as
 * though they were really globals.
 *
 * The SMP parts are setup in pmap.c and locore.s for the BSP, and
 * mp_machdep.c sets up the data for the AP's to "see" when they awake.
 * The reason for doing it via a struct is so that an array of pointers
 * to each CPU's data can be set up for things like "check curproc on all
 * other processors"
