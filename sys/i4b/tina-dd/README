THIS DRIVER IS NOT YET WORKING !
================================

This adds support for the active ISDN card tina-dd manufactured by
Stollmann E+V GmbH in Hamburg, Germany. This card was also sold by 
MIRO as the Miro P1.

Christian Luehrs and Manfred Jung of Stollmann were very helpful
giving out docs and sources to support the development of a driver
for this card.

The card supports many protocols. In order to make the card operable
you'll need the downloadable firmware which also can be found on the
www/ftp server, www.stollmann.de / ftp.stollmann.de.

While developing this driver, i used fcdddss1.loc as of April 1994.

The code is based in part on sources and header files written by
Stollmann for their driver development kit for the tina-dd.
