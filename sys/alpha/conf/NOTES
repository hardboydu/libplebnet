# XXX: On the Alpha, CPU types are never used.  This list also does

# HARDWARE DEVICE CONFIGURATION

#
# Mandatory devices:
#

device		mcclock		# MC146818 real time clock device

# The keyboard controller; it controls the keyboard and the PS/2 mouse.
device		atkbdc
hint.atkbdc.0.at="isa"
hint.atkbdc.0.port="0x060"

# The AT keyboard
device		atkbd
hint.atkbd.0.at="atkbdc"
hint.atkbd.0.irq="1"

# Options for atkbd:
options 	ATKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP	# specify the built-in keymap
makeoptions	ATKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP=jp.106

# These options are valid for other keyboard drivers as well.
options 	KBD_DISABLE_KEYMAP_LOAD	# refuse to load a keymap
options 	KBD_INSTALL_CDEV	# install a CDEV entry in /dev

# `flags' for atkbd:
#       0x01    Force detection of keyboard, else we always assume a keyboard
#       0x02    Don't reset keyboard, useful for some newer ThinkPads
#	0x03	Force detection and avoid reset, might help with certain
#		dockingstations
#       0x04    Old-style (XT) keyboard support, useful for older ThinkPads

# PS/2 mouse
device		psm
hint.psm.0.at="atkbdc"
hint.psm.0.irq="12"

# Options for psm:
options 	PSM_HOOKRESUME		#hook the system resume event, useful
					#for some laptops
options 	PSM_RESETAFTERSUSPEND	#reset the device at the resume event

# Video card driver for VGA adapters.
device		vga
hint.vga.0.at="isa"

# Options for vga:
# Try the following option if the mouse pointer is not drawn correctly
# or font does not seem to be loaded properly.  May cause flicker on
# some systems.
options 	VGA_ALT_SEQACCESS

# If you can dispense with some vga driver features, you may want to
# use the following options to save some memory.
#options 	VGA_NO_FONT_LOADING	# don't save/load font
#options 	VGA_NO_MODE_CHANGE	# don't change video modes

# Older video cards may require this option for proper operation.
options 	VGA_SLOW_IOACCESS	# do byte-wide i/o's to TS and GDC regs

# The following option probably won't work with the LCD displays.
options 	VGA_WIDTH90		# support 90 column modes

# Yet more undocumented options for linting.
options 	VGA_DEBUG

#
# Optional devices:
#

device		tga		# TGA video card driver

# The 'asr' driver provides support for current DPT/Adaptec SCSI RAID
# controllers (SmartRAID V and VI and later).
# These controllers require the CAM infrastructure.
#
device		asr

# The 'dpt' driver provides support for old DPT controllers (http://www.dpt.com/).
# These have hardware RAID-{0,1,5} support, and do multi-initiator I/O.
# The DPT controllers are commonly re-licensed under other brand-names -
# some controllers by Olivetti, Dec, HP, AT&T, SNI, AST, Alphatronic, NEC and
# Compaq are actually DPT controllers.
#
# See src/sys/dev/dpt for debugging and other subtle options.
#   DPT_MEASURE_PERFORMANCE Enables a set of (semi)invasive metrics. Various
#                           instruments are enabled.  The tools in
#                           /usr/sbin/dpt_* assume these to be enabled.
#   DPT_HANDLE_TIMEOUTS     Normally device timeouts are handled by the DPT.
#                           If you ant the driver to handle timeouts, enable
#                           this option.  If your system is very busy, this
#                           option will create more trouble than solve.
#   DPT_TIMEOUT_FACTOR      Used to compute the excessive amount of time to
#                           wait when timing out with the above option.
#  DPT_DEBUG_xxxx           These are controllable from sys/dev/dpt/dpt.h
#  DPT_LOST_IRQ             When enabled, will try, once per second, to catch
#                           any interrupt that got lost.  Seems to help in some
#                           DPT-firmware/Motherboard combinations.  Minimal
#                           cost, great benefit.
#  DPT_RESET_HBA            Make "reset" actually reset the controller
#                           instead of fudging it.  Only enable this if you
#			    are 100% certain you need it.
