/*
 * Functions to be implemented here are:
 *
 * procfs_read_regs(proc, regs)
 *	Get the current user-visible register set from the process
 *	and copy it into the regs structure (<machine/reg.h>).
 *	The process is stopped at the time read_regs is called.
 *
 * procfs_write_regs(proc, regs)
 *	Update the current register set from the passed in regs
 *	structure.  Take care to avoid clobbering special CPU
 *	registers or privileged bits in the PSL.
 *	Depending on the architecture this may have fix-up work to do,
 *	especially if the IAR or PCW are modified.
 *	The process is stopped at the time write_regs is called.
 *
 * procfs_read_fpregs, procfs_write_fpregs
 *	deal with the floating point register set, otherwise as above.
 *
 * procfs_sstep(proc)
 *	Arrange for the process to trap after executing a single instruction.
