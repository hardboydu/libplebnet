/*
 * Implementation of turnstiles used to hold queue of threads blocked on
 * non-sleepable locks.  Sleepable locks use condition variables to
 * implement their queues.  Turnstiles differ from a sleep queue in that
 * turnstile queue's are assigned to a lock held by an owning thread.  Thus,
 * when one thread is enqueued onto a turnstile, it can lend its priority
 * to the owning thread.
 *
 * We wish to avoid bloating locks with an embedded turnstile and we do not
 * want to use back-pointers in the locks for the same reason.  Thus, we
 * use a similar approach to that of Solaris 7 as described in Solaris
 * Internals by Jim Mauro and Richard McDougall.  Turnstiles are looked up
 * in a hash table based on the address of the lock.  Each entry in the
 * hash table is a linked-lists of turnstiles and is called a turnstile
 * chain.  Each chain contains a spin mutex that protects all of the
 * turnstiles in the chain.
 *
 * Each time a thread is created, a turnstile is malloc'd and attached to
 * that thread.  When a thread blocks on a lock, if it is the first thread
 * to block, it lends its turnstile to the lock.  If the lock already has
 * a turnstile, then it gives its turnstile to the lock's turnstile's free
 * list.  When a thread is woken up, it takes a thread from the free list
 * if there are any other waiters.  If it is the only thread blocked on the
 * lock, then it reclaims the turnstile associated with the lock and removes
 * it from the hash table.
 *
 * XXX: We should probably implement some sort of sleep queue that condition
 * variables and sleepqueue's share.  On Solaris condition variables are
 * implemented using a hash table of sleep queues similar to our current
 * sleep queues.  We might want to investigate doing that ourselves.
