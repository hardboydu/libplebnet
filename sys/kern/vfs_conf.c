/*
 * PURPOSE:	This file abstracts the root mounting interface from
 *		the per file system semantics for handling mounts,
 *		the overall intent of which is to move the BSD
 *		internals dependence out of the FS code, both to
 *		make the FS code more portable and to free up some
 *		of the BSD internals so that they may more easily
 *		be changed.
 *
 * NOTE1:	Code is single entry/single exit to aid debugging
 *		and conversion for kernel multithreading.
 *
 * NOTE2:	Code notes lock state in headers on entry and exit
 *		as an aid to conversion for kernel multithreading
 *		on SMP reentrancy
