/*
 * We have NQS (32) run queues per scheduling class.  For the normal
 * class, there are 128 priorities scaled onto these 32 queues.  New
 * processes are added to the last entry in each queue, and processes
 * are selected for running by taking them from the head and maintaining
 * a simple FIFO arrangement.
 *
 * Interrupt, real time and idle priority processes have and explicit
 * 0-31 priority which maps directly onto their class queue index.
 * When a queue has something in it, the corresponding bit is set in
 * the queuebits variable, allowing a single read to determine the
 * state of all 32 queues and then a ffs() to find the first busy
 * queue.
 *
 * XXX This needs fixing.  First, we only have one idle process, so we
 * hardly need 32 queues for it.  Secondly, the number of classes
 * makes things unwieldy.  We should be able to merge them into a
 * single 96 or 128 entry queue.
