 * The hardware default control word for i387's and later coprocessors is
 * 0x37F, giving:
 *
 *	round to nearest
 *	64-bit precision
 *	all exceptions masked.
 *
 * We modify the affine mode bit and precision bits in this to give:
 *
 *	affine mode for 287's (if they work at all) (1 in bitfield 1<<12)
 *	53-bit precision (2 in bitfield 3<<8)
 *
 * 64-bit precision often gives bad results with high level languages
 * because it makes the results of calculations depend on whether
 * intermediate values are stored in memory or in FPU registers.
