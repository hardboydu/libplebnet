# SMP OPTIONS:
#
# The apic device enables the use of the I/O APIC for interrupt delivery.
# The apic device can be used in both UP and SMP kernels, but is required
# for SMP kernels.  Thus, the apic device is not strictly an SMP option,
# but it is a prerequisite for SMP.
#
# Notes:
#
# Be sure to disable 'cpu I386_CPU' for SMP kernels.
#
# By default, mixed mode is used to route IRQ0 from the AT timer via
# the 8259A master PIC through the ExtINT pin on the first I/O APIC.
# This can be disabled via the NO_MIXED_MODE option.  In that case,
# IRQ0 will be routed via an intpin on the first I/O APIC.  Not all
# motherboards hook IRQ0 up to the first I/O APIC even though their
# MP table or MADT may claim to do so.  That is why mixed mode is
# enabled by default.
#

# Optional:

device		mptable
options 	NO_MIXED_MODE		# Disable use of mixed mode

# CPU OPTIONS

# You must specify at least one CPU (the one you intend to run on);
# deleting the specification for CPUs you don't need to use may make
# parts of the system run faster.

#####################################################################
# NETWORKING OPTIONS

#
# DEVICE_POLLING adds support for mixed interrupt-polling handling
# of network device drivers, which has significant benefits in terms
# of robustness to overloads and responsivity, as well as permitting
# accurate scheduling of the CPU time between kernel network processing
# and other activities. The drawback is a moderate (up to 1/HZ seconds)
# potential increase in response times.
# It is strongly recommended to use HZ=1000 or 2000 with DEVICE_POLLING
# to achieve smoother behaviour.
# Additionally, you can enable/disable polling at runtime with the
# sysctl variable kern.polling.enable (defaults off), and select
# the CPU fraction reserved to userland with the sysctl variable
# kern.polling.user_frac (default 50, range 0..100).
#
# Only the "dc" "fxp" and "sis" devices support this mode of operation at
# the time of this writing.

# CLOCK OPTIONS

# The following options are used for debugging clock behavior only, and
# should not be used for production systems.
#
# CLK_CALIBRATION_LOOP will run the clock calibration loop at startup
# until the user presses a key.

# The following two options measure the frequency of the corresponding
# clock relative to the RTC (onboard mc146818a).

# HARDWARE BUS CONFIGURATION

#
device		isa

#
# Options for `isa':
#
# AUTO_EOI_1 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the master 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# This option breaks suspend/resume on some portables.
#
# AUTO_EOI_2 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the slave 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# Automatic EOI is documented not to work for for the slave with the
# original i8259A, but it works for some clones and some integrated
# versions.
#
# MAXMEM specifies the amount of RAM on the machine; if this is not
# specified, FreeBSD will first read the amount of memory from the CMOS
# RAM, so the amount of memory will initially be limited to 64MB or 16MB
# depending on the BIOS.  If the BIOS reports 64MB, a memory probe will
# then attempt to detect the installed amount of RAM.  If this probe
# fails to detect >64MB RAM you will have to use the MAXMEM option.
# The amount is in kilobytes, so for a machine with 128MB of RAM, it would
# be 131072 (128 * 1024).
#
# BROKEN_KEYBOARD_RESET disables the use of the keyboard controller to
# reset the CPU for reboot.  This is needed on some systems with broken
# keyboard controllers.

# 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics, Voodoo II /dev/3dfx CDEV support. This will create
# the /dev/3dfx0 device to work with glide implementations. This should get
# linked to /dev/3dfx and /dev/voodoo. Note that this is not the same as
# the tdfx DRI module from XFree86 and is completely unrelated.
#
# To enable Linuxulator support, one must also include COMPAT_LINUX in the
# config as well, or you will not have the dependencies. The other option
# is to load both as modules.

# ACPI support using the Intel ACPI Component Architecture reference
# implementation.

# ACPI_DEBUG enables the use of the debug.acpi.level and debug.acpi.layer
# kernel environment variables to select initial debugging levels for the
# Intel ACPICA code.  (Note that the Intel code must also have USE_DEBUGGER
# defined when it is built).
#
# ACPI_MAX_THREADS sets the number of task threads started.
#
# ACPI_NO_SEMAPHORES makes the AcpiOs*Semaphore routines a no-op.
#
# ACPICA_PEDANTIC enables strict checking of AML.  Our default is to
# relax these checks to allow code generated by the Microsoft compiler
# to still execute.
#
# Note that building ACPI into the kernel is deprecated; the module is
# normally loaded automatically by the loader.

# SysVR4 ABI emulation
#
# The svr4 ABI emulator can be statically compiled into the kernel or loaded as

# The STREAMS network emulation code can also be compiled statically or as a 
# module.  If loaded as a module, it must be loaded before the svr4 module
# (the /usr/sbin/svr4 script does this for you).  If compiling statically,
# the `streams' device must be configured into any kernel which also
# specifies COMPAT_SVR4.  It is possible to have a statically-configured 
# STREAMS device and a dynamically loadable svr4 emulator;  the /usr/sbin/svr4
# script understands that it doesn't need to load the `streams' module under
# those circumstances.
# Caveat:  At this time, `options KTRACE' is required for the svr4 emulator
# (whether static or dynamic).
