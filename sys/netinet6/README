a note to committers about KAME tree
$FreeBSD$
KAME project


FreeBSD IPv6/IPsec tree is from KAMEproject (http://www.kame.net/).
To synchronize KAME tree and FreeBSD better today and in the future,
please understand the following:

- DO NOT MAKE COSTMETIC CHANGES.
  "Cosmetic changes" here includes tabify, untabify, removal of space at EOL,
  minor KNF items, and whatever adds more output lines on "diff freebsd kame".
  To make future synchronization easier. it is critical to preserve certain
  statements in the code.  Also, as KAME tree supports all 4 BSDs (Free, Open,
  Net, BSD/OS) in single shared tree, it is not always possible to backport
  FreeBSD changes into KAME tree.  So again, please do not make cosmetic
  changes.  Even if you think it a right thing, that will bite KAME guys badly
  during upgrade attempts, and prevent us from synchronizing two trees.
  (you don't usually make cosmetic changes against third-party code, do you?)

- REPORT CHANGES/BUGS TO KAME GUYS.
  It is not always possible for KAME guys to watch all the freebsd mailing
  list traffic, as the traffic is HUGE.  So if possible, please, inform
  kame guys of changes you made in IPv6/IPsec related portion.  Contact
  path would be snap-users@kame.net or KAME PR database on www.kame.net.
  (or to core@kame.net if it is necessary to make it confidential)

Thank you for your cooperation and have a happy IPv6 life!
