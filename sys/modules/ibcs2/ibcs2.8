.Sh NAME
.Nm ibcs2
.Nd load iBCS2 runtime support for SCO and ISC binaries
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ibcs2
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility loads kernel runtime support for iBCS2 compliant programs.
This runtime support is limited to emulation of the iBCS2
system call interface, and is far from complete. COFF binaries
and shared libraries are supported, however no shared libraries
are provided with the FreeBSD distribution.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/share/examples/ibcs2/* -compact
.It Pa /lkm/ibcs2_mod.o
.It Pa /lkm/ibcs2_coff_mod.o
iBCS2 loadable kernel modules.
.Pp
.It Pa /usr/share/examples/ibcs2/*
Sample object files with which to test the emulator.
.Sh "SEE ALSO"
.Xr lkm 4 ,
.Xr modload 8
.Sh BUGS
The emulation is very incomplete.
.Pp
Running dynamically linked binaries requires access to an existing
SCO system from which you can grab the shared libraries.
.Pp
You can't really use this without reading the source code.
