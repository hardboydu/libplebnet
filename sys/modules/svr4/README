This is a SysVR4 emulator derived from work done as part of the NetBSD
Project by Christos Zoulas.  It has been ported to FreeBSD by Mark Newton.

To use it:

1.  Add "pseudo-device streams" to your kernel config file and rebuild,
   reboot.

2.  Build and install the svr4 module in /sys/modules/svr4

3.  Type "svr4" to start it up.

4.  Grab compat_sol26.tar.gz or compat_svr4.tar.gz from
    http://www.freebsd.org/~newton/freebsd-svr4 and install them in
    /compat/svr4

5.  Run "sh SVR4_MAKEDEV all" in /compat/svr4/dev

6.  Mount a Solaris/x86 CD-ROM on /cdrom

7.  Brand any executables you want to run

8.  See if they work.

It's early days yet, folks -- You'll probably have trouble getting 100%
functionality out of most things (specifically, poll() on a socket doesn't
look like it works at the moment, so Netscape doesn't work (among other
things)).  Patches will be appreciated (use send-pr).
