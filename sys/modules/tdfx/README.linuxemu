NOTIC TO USERS OF LINUX EMULATION CODE

Due to some strange workings with the linuxulator, as of 21 Jun 200, this
module won't load support for linux emulation, making it rather pointless,
as there are no non-linux glide progs for freebsd yet. You can, however,
compile both of them statically into the kernel using:
device tdfx
options COMPAT_LINUX
options LINUX_TDFX
