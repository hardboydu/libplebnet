 * Definition of dummynet data structures.
 * We first start with the heap which is used by the scheduler.
 *
 * Each list contains a set of parameters identifying the pipe, and
 * a set of packets queued on the pipe itself.
 *
 * I could have used queue macros, but the management i have
 * is pretty simple and this makes the code more portable.
 */

/*
 * The key for the heap is used for two different values
   1. timer ticks- max 10K/second, so 32 bits are enough
   2. virtual times. These increase in steps of len/x, where len is the
      packet length, and x is either the weight of the flow, or the
      sum of all weights.
      If we limit to max 1000 flows and a max weight of 100, then
      x needs 17 bits. The packet size is 16 bits, so we can easily
      overflow if we do not allow errors.

 * Overall structure (with WFQ):

We have 3 data structures definining a pipe and associated queues:
 + dn_pipe, which contains the main configuration parameters related
   to delay and bandwidth
 + dn_flow_set which contains WFQ configuration, flow
   masks, plr and RED configuration
 + dn_flow_queue which is the per-flow queue.
 Multiple dn_flow_set can be linked to the same pipe, and multiple
 dn_flow_queue can be linked to the same dn_flow_set.

 During configuration we set the dn_flow_set and dn_pipe parameters.
 At runtime: packets are sent to the dn_flow_set (either WFQ ones, or
 the one embedded in the dn_pipe for fixed-rate flows) which in turn
 dispatches them to the appropriate dn_flow_queue (created dynamically
 according to the masks).
 The transmit clock for fixed rate flows (ready_event) selects the
 dn_flow_queue to be used to transmit the next packet. For WF2Q,
 wfq_ready_event() extract a pipe which in turn selects the right
 flow using a number of heaps defined into the pipe.
