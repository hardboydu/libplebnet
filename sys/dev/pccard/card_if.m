# and i/o port mappings (as well as other types of attributes) that have
# a well defined meaning inside the pccard/cardbus system.  The bus
# methods are inadequate for this because this must be done at the time the
# resources are set for the device, which predates their activation.  Also,
# the driver activating the resources doesn't necessarily know or need to know
# these attributes.

# Compatibility methods for OLDCARD drivers.  We use these routines to make
# it possible to call the OLDCARD driver's probe routine in the context that
# it expects.  For OLDCARD these are implemented as pass throughs to the
# device_{probe,attach} routines.  For NEWCARD they are implemented such
# such that probe becomes strictly a matching routine and attach does both
# the old probe and old attach.
#
# compat devices should use the following:
#
#	/* Device interface */
#	DEVMETHOD(device_probe),	pccard_compat_probe),
#	DEVMETHOD(device_attach),	pccard_compat_attach),
#	/* Card interface */
#	DEVMETHOD(card_compat_match,	foo_match),	/* newly written */
#	DEVMETHOD(card_compat_probe,	foo_probe),	/* old probe */
#	DEVMETHOD(card_compat_attach,	foo_attach),	/* old attach */
#
# This will allow a single driver binary image to be used for both
# OLDCARD and NEWCARD.
#
# Drivers wishing to not retain OLDCARD compatibility needn't do this.
#
# The compat_do_* versions are so that we can make the pccard_compat_probe
# and _attach static lines and have the bus system pick the right version
# to use so we don't enshrine pccard_* symbols in the driver's module.
