Two of the uuencoded files in this directory contain
the publicly released firmware that needs to be loaded into the 
Olicom boards for them to work. (Also found in the linux distribution
of the drivers). The third contains an ELF object binary of the 
lowest set of routines that Olicom use to talk at teh register set
level. Olicom consider this interface secret and proprietary, but
allow the inclusion of them in binary form as long as they are being used
in conjunction with a driver to talk with only Olicom boards. (It's hard to see
how else they would be used but...)

Olicom has made these 3 files available in binary for for Linux and freeBSD.

The Olicom board is at the moment the only driver we have for Tokenring,
and as such significantly expands the reach of FreeBSD in IBM shops. If
this were not the case I may not be so quick to put a .o file into the tree
but Olicom have actually been very helpful with assistance except for
this one point.
