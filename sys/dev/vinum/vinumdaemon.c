 * this could be as simple as doing nothing: the defective drives may
 * already be down, and there may be nothing else to do.  In case of
 * a read, it will be necessary to retry if there are alternative
 * copies of the data.
 *
 * The easy way (here) is just to reissue the request.  This will take
 * a little longer, but nothing like as long as the failure will have
