These are the I/O port mapping offsets and bit assignments used by Creative
Labs in their implementation of the host interface adapter for the Matsushita
CD-ROM drive.  These may be different in the adapter cards (including sound
cards) made by other vendors.  It is unknown if the Creative interface is
based on a reference design provided by Matsushita.  (If Matsushita did
provide a reference design, you would expect adapters made by other vendors
to be more compatible.)

Note that the Matsushita drives are actually capable of using DMA and
generating interrupts, but none of the host adapters provide the circuitry
needed to do DMA or generate interrupts.

See matcd.h for defines related to the drive command set.
