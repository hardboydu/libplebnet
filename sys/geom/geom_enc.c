/*
 * This file contains routines to pack and unpack integerfields of varying
 * width and endianess with.  Ideally the C language would have this built
 * in but I guess Dennis and Brian forgot that back in the early 70ies.
 *
 * The function names are systematic: g_{enc|dec}_{be|le}%d
 *	enc -> encode
 *	dec -> decode
 *	be -> big endian
 *	le -> little endian
 *	%d -> width in bytes
 *
 * Please keep the functions sorted:
 *	decode before encode
 *	big endian before little endian
 *	small width before larger width
 *	(this happens to be alphabetically)
