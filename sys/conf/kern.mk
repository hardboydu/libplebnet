# Warning flags for compiling the kernel and components of the kernel.
#
# Note that the newly added -Wcast-qual is responsible for generating 
# most of the remaining warnings.  Warnings introduced with -Wall will
# also pop up, but are easier to fix.

# The following flags are next up for working on:
#	-W
#
# When working on removing warnings from code, the `-Werror' flag should be
# of material assistance.

#
# On the alpha, make sure that we don't use floating-point registers and
# allow the use of EV56 instructions (only needed for low-level i/o).
