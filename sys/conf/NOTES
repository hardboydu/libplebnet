# DEBUG happens to be magic.
# The following is equivalent to 'config -g KERNELNAME' and creates
# 'kernel.debug' compiled with -g debugging as well as a normal

# but that isn't normally necessary as the debug symbols are not loaded
# by the kernel and are not useful there anyway.

# DEBUGGING OPTIONS

#
# Enable the kernel debugger.
#
options 	DDB

#
# Use direct symbol lookup routines for ddb instead of the kernel linker
# ones, so that symbols (mostly) work before the kernel linker has been
# initialized.  This is not the default because it breaks ddb's lookup of
# symbols in loaded modules.
#
#!options 	DDB_NOKLDSYM

#
# Don't drop into DDB for a panic. Intended for unattended operation
# where you may want to drop to DDB from the console, but still want
# the machine to recover from a panic
#
options 	DDB_UNATTENDED

#
# If using GDB remote mode to debug the kernel, there's a non-standard
# extension to the remote protocol that can be used to use the serial
# port as both the debugging port and the system console.  It's non-
# standard and you're on your own if you enable it.  See also the
# "remotechat" variables in the FreeBSD specific version of gdb.
#
options 	GDB_REMOTE_CHAT

#
# KTRACE enables the system-call tracing facility ktrace(2).  To be more
# SMP-friendly, KTRACE uses a worker thread to process most trace events
# asynchronously to the thread generating the event.  This requires a
# pre-allocated store of objects representing trace events.  The
# KTRACE_REQUEST_POOL option specifies the initial size of this store.
# The size of the pool can be adjusted both at boottime and runtime via
# the kern.ktrace_request_pool tunable and sysctl.
#
options 	KTRACE			#kernel tracing
options 	KTRACE_REQUEST_POOL=101

#
# KTR is a kernel tracing mechanism imported from BSD/OS.  Currently it
# has no userland interface aside from a few sysctl's.  It is enabled with
# the KTR option.  KTR_ENTRIES defines the number of entries in the circular
# trace buffer.  KTR_COMPILE defines the mask of events to compile into the
# kernel as defined by the KTR_* constants in <sys/ktr.h>.  KTR_MASK defines the
# initial value of the ktr_mask variable which determines at runtime what
# events to trace.  KTR_CPUMASK determines which CPU's log events, with
# bit X corresponding to cpu X.  KTR_VERBOSE enables dumping of KTR events
# to the console by default.  This functionality can be toggled via the
# debug.ktr_verbose sysctl and defaults to off if KTR_VERBOSE is not defined.

#
options 	INVARIANTS

#
# The INVARIANT_SUPPORT option makes us compile in support for
# verifying some of the internal structures.  It is a prerequisite for
# 'INVARIANTS', as enabling 'INVARIANTS' will make these functions be
# called.  The intent is that you can set 'INVARIANTS' for single
# source files (by changing the source file or specifying it on the
# command line) if you have 'INVARIANT_SUPPORT' enabled.  Also, if you
# wish to build a kernel module with 'INVARIANTS', then adding
# 'INVARIANT_SUPPORT' to your kernel will provide all the necessary
# infrastructure without the added overhead.
#
options 	INVARIANT_SUPPORT

#
# The DIAGNOSTIC option is used to enable extra debugging information
# from some parts of the kernel.  As this makes everything more noisy,
# it is disabled by default.
#
options 	DIAGNOSTIC

#
# REGRESSION causes optional kernel interfaces necessary only for regression
# testing to be enabled.  These interfaces may consitute security risks
# when enabled, as they permit processes to easily modify aspects of the
# run-time environment to reproduce unlikely or unusual (possibly normally
# impossible) scenarios.
#
options 	REGRESSION

#
# RESTARTABLE_PANICS allows one to continue from a panic as if it were
# a call to the debugger via the Debugger() function instead.  It is only
# useful if a kernel debugger is present.  To restart from a panic, reset
# the panicstr variable to NULL and continue execution.  This option is
# for development use only and should NOT be used in production systems
# to "workaround" a panic.
#
#options 	RESTARTABLE_PANICS

# SCSI DEVICES

# SCSI DEVICE CONFIGURATION

# The SCSI subsystem consists of the `base' SCSI code, a number of
# high-level SCSI device `type' drivers, and the low-level host-adapter
# device drivers.  The host adapters are listed in the ISA and PCI
# device configuration sections below.
#
# Beginning with FreeBSD 2.0.5 you can wire down your SCSI devices so
# that a given bus, target, and LUN always come on line as the same
# device unit.  In earlier versions the unit numbers were assigned
# in the order that the devices were probed on the SCSI bus.  This
# means that if you removed a disk drive, you may have had to rewrite
# your /etc/fstab file, and also that you had to be careful when adding
# a new disk as it may have been probed earlier and moved your device
# configuration around.

# This old behavior is maintained as the default behavior.  The unit
# assignment begins with the first non-wired down unit for a device
# type.  For example, if you wire a disk as "da3" then the first
# non-wired disk will be assigned da4.

# The syntax for wiring down devices is:

hint.scbus.0.at="ahc0"
hint.scbus.1.at="ahc1"
hint.scbus.1.bus="0"
hint.scbus.3.at="ahc2"
hint.scbus.3.bus="0"
hint.scbus.2.at="ahc2"
hint.scbus.2.bus="1"
hint.da.0.at="scbus0"
hint.da.0.target="0"
hint.da.0.unit="0"
hint.da.1.at="scbus3"
hint.da.1.target="1"
hint.da.2.at="scbus2"
hint.da.2.target="3"
hint.sa.1.at="scbus1"
hint.sa.1.target="6"

# "units" (SCSI logical unit number) that are not specified are
# treated as if specified as LUN 0.

# All SCSI devices allocate as many units as are required.

# The ch driver drives SCSI Media Changer ("jukebox") devices.
#
# The da driver drives SCSI Direct Access ("disk") and Optical Media
# ("WORM") devices.
#
# The sa driver drives SCSI Sequential Access ("tape") devices.
#
# The cd driver drives SCSI Read Only Direct Access ("cd") devices.
#
# The ses driver drives SCSI Envinronment Services ("ses") and
# SAF-TE ("SCSI Accessable Fault-Tolerant Enclosure") devices.
#
# The pt driver drives SCSI Processor devices.
#
# 
# Target Mode support is provided here but also requires that a SIM
# (SCSI Host Adapter Driver) provide support as well.
#
# The targ driver provides target mode support as a Processor type device.
# It exists to give the minimal context necessary to respond to Inquiry
# commands. There is a sample user application that shows how the rest
# of the command support might be done in /usr/share/examples/scsi_target.
#
# The targbh driver provides target mode support and exists to respond
# to incoming commands that do not otherwise have a logical unit assigned
# to them.
# 
# The "unknown" device (uk? in pre-2.0.5) is now part of the base SCSI
# configuration as the "pass" driver.

# `flags' for serial drivers that support consoles (only for sio now):
#	0x10	enable console support for this unit.  The other console flags
#		are ignored unless this is set.  Enabling console support does
#		not make the unit the preferred console - boot with -h or set
#		the 0x20 flag for that.  Currently, at most one unit can have
#		console support; the first one (in config file order) with
#		this flag set is preferred.  Setting this flag for sio0 gives
#		the old behaviour.
#	0x20	force this unit to be the console (unless there is another
#		higher priority console).  This replaces the COMCONSOLE option.
#	0x40	reserve this unit for low level console operations.  Do not
#		access the device in any normal way.
#	0x80	use this port for serial line gdb support in ddb.
#
# PnP `flags'
#	0x1	disable probing of this device.  Used to prevent your modem
#		from being attached as a PnP modem.

# bt848/bt848a/bt849a/bt878/bt879 chipset. When used with a TV Tuner it forms a
# TV card, eg Miro PC/TV, Hauppauge WinCast/TV WinTV, VideoLogic Captivator,
# Intel Smart Video III, AverMedia, IMS Turbo, FlyVideo.
#
# options 	OVERRIDE_CARD=xxx
# options 	OVERRIDE_TUNER=xxx
# options 	OVERRIDE_MSP=1
# options 	OVERRIDE_DBX=1
# These options can be used to override the auto detection
# The current values for xxx are found in src/sys/dev/bktr/bktr_card.h
# Using sysctl(8) run-time overrides on a per-card basis can be made
#
# options 	BROOKTREE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT=BROOKTREE_PAL
# or
# options 	BROOKTREE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT=BROOKTREE_NTSC
# Specifes the default video capture mode.
# This is required for Dual Crystal (28&35Mhz) boards where PAL is used
# to prevent hangs during initialisation.  eg VideoLogic Captivator PCI.
#
# options 	BKTR_USE_PLL
# PAL or SECAM users who have a 28Mhz crystal (and no 35Mhz crystal)
# must enable PLL mode with this option. eg some new Bt878 cards.
#
# options 	BKTR_GPIO_ACCESS
# This enable IOCTLs which give user level access to the GPIO port.
#
# options 	BKTR_NO_MSP_RESET
# Prevents the MSP34xx reset. Good if you initialise the MSP in another OS first
#
# options 	BKTR_430_FX_MODE
# Switch Bt878/879 cards into Intel 430FX chipset compatibility mode.
#
# options 	BKTR_SIS_VIA_MODE
# Switch Bt878/879 cards into SIS/VIA chipset compatibility mode which is
# needed for some old SiS and VIA chipset motherboards.
# This also allows Bt878/879 chips to work on old OPTi (<1997) chipset
# motherboards and motherboards with bad or incomplete PCI 2.1 support.
# As a rough guess, old = before 1998

# Enable extra debugging code for locks.  This stores the filename and
# line of whatever acquired the lock in the lock itself, and change a
# number of function calls to pass around the relevant data.  This is
# not at all useful unless you are debugging lock code.  Also note
# that it is likely to break e.g. fstat(1) unless you recompile your
# userland with -DDEBUG_LOCKS as well.
