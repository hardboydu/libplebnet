This is VERY MUCH ALPHA SOFTWARE.  You MUST know what you're doing to
use this, or else!!!

Ok, everything's been renamed to reference an "aic7xxx" driver instead
of "aha274x", and a merger of the two PCI patches I had has been put in,
along with re-doing the detection and configuration routines.  To summarize
the status: it compiles cleanly.  I don't expect it to work off the bat,
but it's for the 294x development people to synchronize their code
together.

The file scsi-diffs-1.1.59 is NOT a proper patch file, but some diffs
to kernel files concatenated together.  I've sent these off to Drew,
but if you're testing this you'll have to apply them - it allows a
per-driver-instance can_queue variable, which for the aic7xxx driver
is the number of SCBs the card supports.

Good luck!  I await your comments.. Mark, Alan - let me know where I
broke it, please ;-)
