.Sh NAME
.Nm yp_mkdb
.Nd "generate the NIS databases"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm yp_mkdb
.Fl u Ar dbname
.Nm yp_mkdb
.Op Fl i Ar inputfile
.Op Fl o Ar outputfile
.Op Fl m Ar mastername
.Ar inputfile
.Ar dbname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm yp_mkdb
creates
.Xr db 3
style databases for use with FreeBSD's NIS server.
.Nm yp_mkdb
reads data from
.Nm inputfile ,
and writes it to
.Nm dbname
in
.Xr db 3
format (using the hash table method).
The input should be in 'key data' format, which is to say
two fields of ASCII data separated by white space. The first field
is assumed to be the key, and everything else is assumed to be
the data.
These databases are typically stored in
.Nm /var/yp/[domainname]
where
.Nm domainname
is the name of the NIS domain being served. 
.Nm yp_mkdb
is usually invoked by
.Nm /var/yp/Makefile.
.Nm yp_mkdb
can also be used to dump an NIS database file so that its
contents can be examined. For security reasons, all databases that
.Nm yp_mkdb
creates are readable and writable by owner only (and usually the
owner is root).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl u Ar dbname
.Pp
Dump (or 'unwind') an NIS database. This option can be used to
inspect the contents of an existing NIS database.
.It Op Fl i Ar inputfile
.Pp
When generating an NIS map, encode
.Nm inputfile
as a special entry in the database with called
.Nm YP_INPUT_FILE.
.Pp
.It Op Fl o Ar outputfile
.Pp
When generating an NIS map, encode
.Nm outputfile
as a special entry in the database with called
.Nm YP_OUTPUT_FILE .
.Pp
.It Op Fl m Ar mastername
.Pp
When generating an NIS map encode
.Nm mastername
as a special entry in the database with called
.Nm YP_MASTER_NAME .
This entry in the database is frequently used by various NIS utilities
to determine the name of an NIS master server for a domain. By default,
.Nm yp_mkdb
assumes that the local host is the NIS master; the
.Ar m
option is used to override this default.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact
.It Pa /var/yp/Makefile
The Makefile that calls
.Nm yp_mkdb
to build the NIS databases.
