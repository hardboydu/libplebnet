Installation notes for the ii ISDN Interface
	for FreeBSD Release 1.0
	  08.Oct.1994

1. Login as root

2. Use vipw to create a login isdn. It has to be an alias to root.
   the login directory has to be /isdn:
	isdn:*:0:0:Bourne-again Superuser:/isdn:

3. The ISDN Interface supports the NICCY 3008 , NICCY 3009 and the
   NICCY 5000.  Please see /sys/i386/conf/LINT for more details on
   how to enable a given ISDN adapter for your system.

4. You have to edit some files for your local installation:
6.1 /usr/sbin/sisdn
6.2 /usr/share/isdn/isdn.ip
6.3 /etc/remote
6.4 /etc/ttys

5. Install the new kernel and reboot your system.

6. Login as isdn and start
	sisdn


Configuration of NICCY 3008.

The 3008 is an 8bit card. It uses shared memory and does not support or
is not supported by a 16bit card in the same 8 ( or 16K ) area of shared memory.

As configured it is running using the I/O adress of COM3, Interupt 5 and
the shared memory at 0xde000.
But Interupt 5 is occupied by ne1000, ne2000 and WDxxxx ethernet cards. The
WDxxxx cards use shared memory in the 0xdxxxx region.

That is why I configured the kernel for the 3008 to use COM3, interupt 2/9
and shared memory at 0xe0000. You have to jumper:

B7 B4a B4b B1a B1b B1c B1d


Problems with the NICCY 5000.

The 5000 was constructed for the MAC. So it has this strange MAC-SCSI connector.
When connecting to an Adaptec you have to buy a cable which connects to MAC-SCSI
and a terminator for the MAC-SCSI. Be shure to terminate the SCSI-Bus
correctly !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Older Versions of the NICCY will not run
on Adaptec with enabled boot rom. Disable boot rom or/and get a new set of
rom for the 5000.
