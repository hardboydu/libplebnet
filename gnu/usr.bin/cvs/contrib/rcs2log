# RCS to ChangeLog generator

# Generate a change log prefix from RCS/* and the existing ChangeLog (if any).
# Output the new prefix to standard output.
# You can edit this prefix by hand, and then prepend it to ChangeLog.

# Ignore log entries that start with `#'.
# Clump together log entries that start with `{topic} ',
# where `topic' contains neither white space nor `}'.
