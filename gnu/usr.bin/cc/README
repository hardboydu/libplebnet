This directory contains gcc in a form that uses "bmake" makefiles.
This is not the place you want to start, if you want to hack gcc.
we have included everything here which is part of the source-code
of gcc, but still, don't use this as a hacking-base.

If you suspect a problem with gcc, or just want to hack it in general,
get a complete gcc-X.Y.Z.tar.gz from somewhere, and use that.

Please look in the directory src/gnu/gnu2bmake to find the tools
to generate these files.

Thankyou.
