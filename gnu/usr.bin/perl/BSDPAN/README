$FreeBSD$

For importers of the future Perl versions.  BSDPAN operation depends on
the fact it is loaded before system Perl modules.  To achieve this, the
semi-documented (it is described as undocumented in Perl documentation)
define APPLLIB_EXP is used.  Run Perl configure as follows (with other
relevant arguments of course):

   sh Configure -Dccflags='-DAPPLLIB_EXP="/usr/libdata/perl/BSDPAN"'

Since FreeBSD uses its own Makefile to build Perl, it is necessary to
duplicate this as an extra CFLAG.  This resides currently in
gnu/usr.bin/perl/Makefile.inc:

   CFLAGS+=	'-DAPPLLIB_EXP="/usr/libdata/perl/BSDPAN"'

If APPLLIB_EXP ever gets removed from Perl, some other way of putting
/usr/libdata/perl/BSDPAN in the start of @INC must be devised.
