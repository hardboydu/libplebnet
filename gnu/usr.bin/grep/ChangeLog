	to detect loops.

1998-12-29 Kaveh R. Ghazi

	intl/localealias.c: When building grep-2.2e using cc on Irix4,
	I needed the following patch to intl/localealias.c.
	(Its the same patch used by fileutils-4.0.) The patch resolves
	conflicts between char* and unsigned char* in the i18n code.

1998-12-10 Alain Magloire

	* src/grep.c : Typo in contex -->context

	* grep-2.2e beta to test DJGPP port.

1998-11-28  Paul Eggert

	Various portability enhancements:
	- Don't assume that O_BINARY implies DOS.  Use separate
	macros D_OK (for DOS-like directory access) and
	HAVE_DOS_FILE_NAMES (for DOS-like file names).
	- Don't assume that off_t fits into long; it doesn't on Solaris 2.6.
	- Have is_EISDIR set errno properly on hosts with screwed-up EISDIR.
	- Treat ':' specially in DOS file names only if it's the end of a
	drive specifier.
	- Protect against errno < 0.

	* src/grep.c (is_EISDIR): Move defn to system.h.
	(print_offset_sep): New function.
	(fillbuf): Remove redundant test of O_BINARY.
	(totalcc, totalnl): Now of type off_t.
	(prline): Use print_offset_sep to print file offsets.
	(grepfile): Don't set e to EISDIR; that's is_EISDIR's responsibility
	on machines that don't work properly with EISDIR.
	(grepdir): Don't assume ':' means slash on all DOS filenames;
	it means it only in the file prefix.

	* src/system.h (strerror): Check for negative error numbers.
	(is_EISDIR): Depend on D_OK, not O_BINARY.
	(SET_BINARY): Depend on HAVE_SETMODE, not __DJGPP__.
	(IS_SLASH, FILESYSTEM_PREFIX_LEN): Depend on HAVE_DOS_FILE_NAMES,
	not O_BINARY.
	(CHAR_BIT): New macro.

	po/Makefile.in.in on DOS filesystems, and to run config.sed.

1998-11-24  Jim Meyering

	* src/grep.c : Typo s/infalid/invalid/
	Also noted by Stanislav Brabec.

1998-11-24  Eli Zaretskii

	* doc/grep.texi: I found and corrected several typos.
	I believe the GNU standards require the section that describes the
	options to the programs to be called ``Invoking'' or ``Invoking
	<program-name>''.  This is so users and programs can easily find
	that node in any Info file.  So I changed the name of the
	`Options' chapter to `Invoking', and corrected the
	cross-references accordingly.
	I added some markup to things like file names and options.
	I added some additional index entries where that seemed useful.
	I also corrected some index entries, such as "@cindex [:alnum:]",
	which used a colon in them (the colons confuse Info readers).

1998-11-24  Alain Magloire

	* src/grep.c (grepdir): Fix bug: memory freed twice.

	* src/search.c (Gcompile, Ecompile): Don't invoke dfainit,
	since dfacomp does it for us, and if we also do it then we
	leak memory.

	Nit from Paul Eggert.

1998-11-06 Alain Magloire

	(long_options): Let -C/--context take an optional argument.

1998-11-03 Alain Magloire

	* src/dfa.c: HP-UX define clrbit/setbit as macros in <sys/param.h>

	Noted and patched by Joel N. Weber II.

1998-04-17 Kaveh R. Ghazi

1998-04-16 Alain Magloire

	* tests/{status,empty}.sh: wrong return status.

	* src/grep.c: Remove the REGEX part in usage (), it was
	consider overkill by most.

1998-04-14  Eli Zaretskii

	* djgpp/config.bat: Support file names with multiple dots on all
	platforms.

	* djgpp/README: Add instructions about file names illegal on
	MS-DOS.

1998-04-13 Alain Magloire

	* src/dfa.c: by "popular" demand reverse
	back to '_' not word-constituent.

	* grep-2.1.1c available for testing.

1998-04-13  Karl Heuer

	* src/grep.c: (a) The directory check is done too early:
	logically, if the argument is "-", then it refers to standard
	input, regardless of whether there's something in the file
	system answering to "-".
	(b) The sh command "grep -l root /etc/passwd /etc/group 0<&-"
	prints "(standard input)" instead of "/etc/passwd", because it
	mistakenly believes that a named file will never be opened on fd
	0.  The string "(standard input)" should be based on the file
	having been originally specified as "-", rather than making
	assumptions about the fd.
	(c) the code that calls close(fd) is being done outside of the
	test for a bad fd.  Thus, if the open failed, this code will
	attempt to close(-1).  It should be done inside the "fd != -1"
	branch.
	This patch addresses all three of these problems.

1998-04-13 Alain Magloire

	* configure.in: remove the deprecated AC_ISC_POSIX macro.
	Spotted by Karl Heuer.

	buffer.  Spotted by Paul Eggert.

1998-03-27  Alain Magloire

	* grep-2.1.1b.tar.gz available.

	* src/regex.c: CLASS_CHAR_MAX set to 256 instead of 6
	when WCTYPE and WCHAR are not defined. When class names
	where bigger then 6, it will not detect an error.
	example '[[:alphabet:]]'.

	* Updated the copyright of the files with emacs.
	With emacs Jim :).

1998-03-26 Jim Meyering

	* src/dfa.c (IS_WORD_CONSTITUENT): Define.

	a simple cat.
	Noted By Jim Meyering.

	* src/regex.c: #undef ISASCII and ISPRINT before defining
	them(On Solaris it was define).
	Pattern 'a[[:]:]]b' is an invalid char class and the error
	from regex was 1(REG_NOMATCH) instead of 2 (REG_ECTYPE).
	Fix with help from Ulrich Drepper.

	* src/grep.c (usage): Ulrich wrote: "A single printf should
	not have more than 900 bytes. For translation reasons the
	text shouldn't be split in too many pieces since this is
	tiresome and also does not help to generate a consistent picture."
	Noted by Ulrich Drepper.
	* src/grep.c (usage): Dig out and old patch from
	Franc,ois to explain the regex in usage().
	Ideas from Franc,ois Pinard.

1998-03-23 Alain Magloire

	* testing: grep-2.1.1a for testing.

	* configure.in: Solaris needs '-lw' if we use wchar/wctype
	functions.

	have it define.
	* configure.in : check for btowc ().

	* regex.c: Include <wchar.h> before <wctype.h>, to work around
	a Solaris 2.5 bug.
	Patch provided by Paul Eggert.

	* tests/status.sh: new file to check return status code.
	* tests/empty.sh: new file to check for empty pattern.

	variables.
	Done by Paul Eggert.

	* src/grep.c (usage): change prep.ai.mit.edu for gnu.org.

1998-03-18 Alain Magloire

	* src/grep.c (usage): Formating the --help message a bit off.
	Noted by William Bader.

	* src/grep.c (main): When checking conflicting matcher for option -E the
	matcher was to "egrep" instead of "posix-egrep".
	Reported by kwzh@gnu.org.

	* src/grep.c: Typos and rewording the --help message.
	Reported by Karl Heuer.

	* src/grep.1: The man page wording :
	  A regular expression matching a single character may be
	  followed by one of several repetition operators:
	is unclear since 'x(yz)*z' is a valid regex.
	Remove the "matching a single character".
	Suggested by Harald Hanche-Olsen.

	* src/grep.c (main): `-f /dev/null' now specifies no patterns
	and therfore matches nothing.
	Reported by Jorge Stolfi.
	Patched by Paul Eggert.

1998-03-10 Alain Magloire

	* Ice storm 98(el nino). Lost grep repository disk,

1997-11-01 Alain Magloire

	* src/grep.c: For the long options, the problems are:
	--file appears in the option table as 'no_argument'
	instead of 'required_argument'.
	--files-with-matches is missing from the option table.
	The help lists '--fixed-strings' as the long option for -F,
	the table has '--fixed-regexp'.
	--regexp appears in the option table as 'no_argument'
	instead of 'required_argument'.
	--with-filename is missing from the option table.
	Reported by Grant McDorman and Krishna Sethuraman.

1997-10-19 Alain Magloire

	* src/grep.c: the option "with-filename was not in the arg table.
	Corrected by Jim Hand.

	* GNU gettext library from gettext-0.10.32.

	* src/grep.c: reverse back to greping directories,
	One could skip the error message by defining
	SKIP_DIR_ERROR. There is no clear way of doing
	things, I hope to setle this on the next majore release
	Thanks Paul Eggert, Eli Zaretskii and gnits for the
	exchange.

	* tests/status.sh: add this check to make sure
	That the return status code is ok.

	(setmatcher) [HAVE_SETRLIMIT]: Set re_max_failures so that the
	matcher won't ever overflow the stack.
	(main) [__MSDOS__, _WIN32]: Handle backslashes and drive letters
	in argv[0], remove the .exe suffix, and downcase the prgram name.
	[O_BINARY]: Pass additional DOS-specific options to getopt_long
	and handle them.  Call stat before attempting to open the file, in
	case it is a directory (DOS will fail the open call for
	directories).  Switch the input descriptor to binary mode, unless
	it is a terminal device.

	* system.h [O_BINARY]: Define macros to switch a handle to binary
	mode, so binary files could be grep'ed on MS-DOS and MS-Windows.
	[HAVE_SETLOCALE]: Test for HAVE_SETLOCALE instead of
	HAVE_LC_MESSAGES, to prevent compilation error in grep.c on
	systems which don't define HAVE_LC_MESSAGES, but have setlocale.

	* dosbuf.c: New file, functions specific for MS-DOS/MS-Windows.
	(guess_type, undossify_input, dossified_pos): New functions.

	* djgpp/config.h, djgpp/config.bat, djgpp/main.mak, djgpp/src.mak,
	djgpp/po.mak, djgpp/intl.mak, djgpp/tests.mak, djgpp/po2tbl.sed:
	New files, for building Grep with DJGPP tools for MS-DOS and
	MS-Windows.

	* grep.1: Document DOS-specific switches.

1997-08-08 Alain Magloire

	* grep-2.0e: available for testing

	* grep.c: change LC_MESSAGE to LC_ALL for (LC_CTYPE).
	Suggested by Jochen Hein.

	* ABOUT-NLS: updated.
	* grep.c: --version: more verbosity (COPYRIGHT).
	* grep.c: --help: PATTERN, FILE instead of <pattern>, <file>.
	* INSTALL.grep: not necessary removed.
	* configure.in: --disable-regex rename --without-include-regex.
	* THANKS: format: first row name, second email.
	* ChangeLog: format ISO 8601.
	Reported by Franc,ois Pinard.

	* grep.c: move dcl of struct stat st into "else" where it's used.
	Reported by Jim Meyering.

	* grep.c: totalnl should be %u in printf.
	Reported by Michael Aichlmay
	Corrected with guidance from Ulrich Drepper

1997-07-24 Alain Magloire <alainm@rcsm.ee.mcgill.ca>

	* Makefile.am: corrected an error when installing {f,e}grep.1.
	From Kaveh R. Ghazi <ghazi@caip.rutgers.edu>.
	From Ulrich Drepper <drepper@cygnus.com>.

	* Many files: use PARAMS instead of __STDC__ for prototypes.
	From Jim Meyering <meyering@eng.ascend.com>.
	Patch provided by Kaveh R. Ghazi <ghazi@caip.rutgers.edu>.

	* dfa.[ch]: uses the one in gawk-3.0.3 with the patch from
	Arnold (see Changelog: July 12 1997)

	* grep.1: a note to say -l, -L, -q stop on first match.
	Noted by Andrew Beattie <gaffer@tug.com>.

	* grep.c: refuse to scan if the file is a directory.
	This was causing problems on SUNs. If the directory contains
	a file that could match the pattern, garbage was display.

	* tests directory: added new set of tests from Henry Spencer
	regex package. Change the way the tests were done to be more
	conformant to automake.

	* configure.in: added --disable-regex for folks with their own fuctions.

	* grep-20d : available for testing

1997-07-18 Alain Magloire <alainm@rcsm.ee.mcgill.ca>

1997-07-17 Alain Magloire <alainm@rcsm.ee.mcgill.ca>

	* src/grep.c: Cause grep to fail if `fclose (stdout)' fails.
	From Jim Meyering <meyering@eng.ascend.com>.

	* grep.c:usage() more consistency in the --help.

	* egrep, fgrep were links This is in violation of GNU standards:
	"Please don't make the behavior of a utility depend on the name used
	to invoke it.  It is useful sometimes to make a link to a utility with
	a different name, and that should not change what it does."
	For now egrep and fgrep will be copies of grep. A better scheme
	should be found later.
	After discussion with Tom Tromey <tromey@cygnus.com>.

	* fgrep.man and egrep.man included: They are stubs that call grep.1.
	* Makefile.am: modified to install {f,e,}grep[,.1].

	* speed hack for -l, -L: bail out on first match.
	From Scott Weikart <scott@igc.apc.org>.

	* *.[ch]: provided prototypes for strict argument checking
	With the help of Stewart Levin <stew@sep.stanford.edu>.
