.Sh NAME
.Nm yppush
.Nd "force propagation of updated NIS databases"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm yppush
.Op Fl d Ar domain
.Op Fl v
.Ar mapname
.Op Ar mapname ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm yppush
distributes updated NIS databases (or
.Pa maps )
from an NIS master server to NIS slave servers within an NIS
domain. It is normally only run on the NIS master by
.Pa /var/yp/Makefile
whenever any of the NIS maps are updated. Note that
.Pa /var/yp/Makefile
does not invoke
.Nm yppush
by default: the
.Nm NOPUSH=True
entry in the Makefile must first be commented out
(the default FreeBSD configuration assumes a small network with only
a single NIS server; in such a configuration,
.Nm yppush
is not needed).
.Pp
.Nm yppush
determines the names of the slave servers for a domain by searching the
.Pa ypservers
map. Once it has a complete list of slave servers, it sends a request
to each of them to initiate a map transfer, which is done using
.Xr ypxfr 8 .
Included within each request is the name of the map to be copied
and some special information required by
.Xr ypxfr 8
to successfully 'callback' to
.Nm yppush
and carry out the transfer. Any status or error messages
.Nm yppush
receives from
.Xr ypxfr 8
will be printed to stdout.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are supported by
.Nm yppush :
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl d Ar domain
Specify a particular domain. The NIS domain of
the host system is used by default.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode: causes
.Nm yppush
to print debugging messages as it runs.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact
.It Pa /var/yp/[domainname]/ypservers
The NIS ypservers map containing the names of all servers in
a particular NIS domain.

.Xr ypxfr 8 ,
.Xr yp 8
.Sh BUGS
The mechanism for transfering NIS maps in NIS version 1 is different
that that in NIS version 2. This version of
.Nm yppush
has support for transfering maps to NIS version 1 systems, but this
support has not been tested and is not guaranteed to work. Fortunately,
the majority of systems today use NIS version 2.
