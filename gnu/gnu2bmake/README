This directory contains tools to convert GNU-distributions into bmake-able
trees to be included in the FreeBSD distribution.

*** If you want to hack and of the GNU-sources, get the real thing !
*** We only do this because it is easier for us to cut a release when
*** all directories are "bmakeable".

The tools are written in Tcl, so you need to install that first.

If there is a patch-file, you should apply that to the distribution first.

You should read the tcl-script first, at least the beginning, to see if there
are any special instructions.

We try to get these patches rolled back into the GNU-distributions, to avoid
code-drift.  Please consider very carefully before doing something which isn't
general enough to make it back into the GNU-dist.

If you want to create a new script, here are some hints:

	Get as much info as you can from the Makefiles macros.

	Use this sequence to test:
		make all
		make clean ; make all
		make cleandir ; make depend ; make all ; make install
		make cleandir ; make obj ; make depend ; make all ; make install
		make cleandir

	Remember to install man-pages (and .texi files ?)

Thanks to Bruce for the patches to gcc, he knows a LOT more about gcc 
than I do...
