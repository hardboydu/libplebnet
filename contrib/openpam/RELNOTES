		 Release notes for OpenPAM Digitalis
		 ===================================

This release incorporates several major changes and improvements and
should be considered BETA QUALITY.

This release corresponds to the code used in FreeBSD-CURRENT as of the
release date.  It is also known to build cleanly on NetBSD 1.6,
OpenBSD 3.1, and a number of glibc-based Linux platforms (with BSD
make installed).  It may or may not build on other platforms; you will
need a BSD-compatible make(1) (NetBSD's make(1) is easy to port to
most POSIX platforms).  Previous versions were successfully built on
MacOS X 10.1, but there seem to be issues with the heavily modified
version of GCC 3.1 that ships with MacOS X 10.2.

The library itself is complete.  Documentation exists in the form of
man pages for the library functions.  These man pages are generated by
a Perl script from specially marked-up comments in the source files
themselves, which minimizes the chance that any of them should be out
of date.

The distribution also includes three sample modules (pam_deny,
pam_permit and pam_unix) and a sample application (su).  These are not
intended for actual use, but rather to serve as examples for module or
application developers.

NOTE: to the person who sent me MacOS patches in July 2002: I have
lost your name and email address.  Please contact me so I can give you
proper credit for your contribution.

Please direct bug reports and inquiries to des@freebsd.org.
