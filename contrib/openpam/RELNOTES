		 Release notes for OpenPAM Caliopsis
		 ===================================

This is a beta release.

The library itself is mostly complete.  Documentation exists in the
form of skeletal man pages for the library itself, but no detailed
documentation is provided in this release.

This release is primarily intended for reviewers and developers
interested in testing OpenPAM on FreeBSD.  It has not been tested on
any other OS, though it should build and run with minimal tweaks on
NetBSD and OpenBSD.

Known issues:

  - The pam_get_user() and pam_get_authtok() functions do not check
    for commonly used options such as {use,try}_first_pass or
    auth_as_self.  In fact, pam_get_authtok() behaves as if
    try_first_pass was always specified.

  - The provided conversation function, openpam_ttyconv(), should
    block signals, and support some sort of timeout.

  - The documentation is far from complete.
