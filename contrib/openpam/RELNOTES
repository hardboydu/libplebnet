		  Release notes for OpenPAM Cinchona
		  ==================================

This is a beta release.

The library itself is complete.  Documentation exists in the form of
man pages for the library functions, though a few pages are still
incomplete.

This release is incorporated into FreeBSD-CURRENT as of 2002-04-08.
It has also been successfully built on NetBSD, and should build with
minimal or no changes on OpenBSD.  It has not been tested on any other
OS.

Known issues:

  - The documentation is still incomplete.

  - It should be possible to create incomplete modules without
    recourse to placeholders or elaborate preprocessor tricks.  This
    is made difficult by the requirement that it should be possible to
    link modules statically.
