		  Release notes for OpenPAM Daffodil
		  ==================================

This is a bugfix release.  The previous release, Cyclamen, was rushed
out without sufficient testing, and contained a number of small but
serious errors.

This release corresponds to the code used in FreeBSD-CURRENT as of the
release date.  It has also been successfully built on NetBSD 1.6, and
should build with minimal or no changes on OpenBSD.  Work is underway
to port OpenPAM to MacOS 10.2.  It has not been tested on any other
operating system.

The library itself is complete.  Documentation exists in the form of
man pages for the library functions.  These man pages are generated by
a Perl script from specially marked-up comments in the source files
themselves, which minimizes the chance that any of them should be out
of date.

The distribution also includes three sample modules (pam_deny,
pam_permit and pam_unix) and a sample application (su).  These are not
intended for actual use, but rather to serve as examples for module or
application developers.

NOTE: to the person who sent me MacOS patches in July 2002: I have
lost your name and email address.  Please contact me so I can give you
proper credit for your contribution.
