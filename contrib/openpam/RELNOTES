		  Release notes for OpenPAM Calamite
		  ==================================

This is a beta release.

The library itself is mostly complete.  Documentation exists in the
form of skeletal man pages for the library itself, but no detailed
documentation is provided in this release.

This release is primarily intended for reviewers and developers
interested in testing OpenPAM on FreeBSD.  It has not been tested on
any other OS, though it should build and run with minimal tweaks on
NetBSD and OpenBSD.
