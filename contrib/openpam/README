OpenPAM is an open source PAM library that focuses on simplicity,
correctness, and cleanliness.

OpenPAM aims to gather the best features of Solaris PAM, XSSO and
Linux-PAM, plus some innovations of its own.  In areas where these
implementations disagree, OpenPAM tries to remain compatible with
Solaris, at the expense of XSSO conformance and Linux-PAM
compatibility.

These are some of OpenPAM's features:	 

   - Implements the complete PAM API as described in the original PAM
     paper and in OSF-RFC 86.0; this corresponds to the full XSSO API
     except for mappings and secondary authentication.

   - Extends the API with several useful and time-saving functions:
     pam_error(), pam_get_authtok(), pam_info(), pam_prompt(),
     pam_setenv(), pam_verror(), pam_vinfo(), pam_vprompt()

   - Offers a number of time-saving convenience functions:
     openpam_log(), openpam_ttyconv().

   - Performs strict checking of return values from service modules.

   - Reads configuration from /etc/pam.d/, /usr/local/etc/pam.d/ and
     /etc/pam.conf, in that order; this will be made configurable in a
     future release.Please direct bug reports and inquiries to
     openpam@thinksec.com.
