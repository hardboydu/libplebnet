The
.Nm
function returns the name of the target user, as
specified to
.Xr pam_start 3 .
If no user was specified, nor set using
.Xr pam_set_item 3 ,

will prompt for a user name.  Either way,
a pointer to the user name is stored in the location pointed to by the
.Va user
argument.

The
.Va prompt
argument specifies a prompt to use if no user name is
cached.  If it is
.Dv NULL ,
the
.Dv PAM_USER_PROMPT
will be used.  If that
item is also
.Dv NULL ,
a hardcoded default prompt will be used.
