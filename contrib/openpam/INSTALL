			  Installing OpenPAM
			  ==================

1. REQUIREMENTS

  This release of OpenPAM is targeted at FreeBSD-CURRENT, and has not
  been tested on other platforms.  It should, however, build with
  little or no trouble other BSDs such as BSDI, Darwin, NetBSD or
  OpenBSD, and should not prove much of a challenge to port to other
  platforms, except for the static linking support.

2. CONFIGURATION

  No configuration is necessary or possible at this time.

3. COMPILATION

  Change into the top-level OpenPAM directory and run 'make'.

4. INSTALLATION
 
  Change into the top-level OpenPAM directory and run 'make install'.
