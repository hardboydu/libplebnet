.Sh DESCRIPTION
These interfaces may be used to look up information from the
.Xr audit_control 5
database, which contains various audit-related administrative parameters.
.Pp
.Fn setac
resets the database iterator to the beginning of the database; see the
BUGS section for more information.
.Pp
.Fn sendac
closes the
.Xr audit_control 5
database.
.Pp
.Fn getacdir
returns the name of the directory where log data is stored via the passed
character buffer
.Va name
of length
.Va len .
.Pp
.Fn getacmin
returns the minimum free disk space for the audit log target file system via
the passed
.Va min_val
variable.
.Pp
.Fn getacfilesz
returns the audit trail rotation size in the passed size_t buffer
.Fa size_val .
.Pp
.Fn getacflg
returns the audit system flags via the the passed character buffer
.Va auditstr
of length
.Va len .
.Pp
.Fn getacna
returns the non-attributable flags via the passed character buffer
.Va auditstr
of length
.Va len .
.Pp
.Fn getacpol
returns the audit policy flags via the passed character buffer
.Va auditstr
of length
.Va len .
.Pp
.Fn au_poltostr
converts a numeric audit policy mask,
.Va policy ,
value to a string in the passed character buffer
.Va buf
of lenth
.Va maxsize .
.Pp
.Fn au_strtopol
converts an audit policy flags string,
.Va polstr ,
to a numeric audit policy mask returned via
.Va policy .
.Sh RETURN VALULES
.Fn getacdir ,
.Fn getacmin ,
.Fn getacflg ,
.Fn getacna ,
.Fn getacpol ,
and
.Fn au_strtopol
return 0 on success, or a negative value on failure, along with error
information in
.Va errno .
.Pp
.Fn au_poltostr
returns a string length of 0 or more on success, or a negative value on
if there is a failure.
.Pp
Functions that return a string value will return a failure if there is
insufficient room in the passed character buffer for the full string.

.Sh AUTHORS
This software was created by Robert Watson, Wayne Salamon, and Suresh
Krishnaswamy for McAfee Research, the security research division of McAfee,
Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc.
.Pp
The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit event
stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.
.Sh HISTORY
The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc., in 2004.
It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation for
the OpenBSM distribution.
.Sh BUGS
These routines cannot currently distinguish between an entry not being found
and an error accessing the database.
The implementation should be changed to return an error via
.Va errno
when
.Dv NULL
is returned.
.Sh BUGS
There is no reason for the
.Fn setac
interface to be exposed as part of the public API, as it is called implicitly
by other access functions and iteration is not supported.
.Pp
These interfaces inconsistently return various negative values depending on
the failure mode, and do not always set
.Va errno
on failure.
