Upgrade Instructions for OpenBSM
--------------------------------

Currently this is very straight forward:

  cd ~/p4/projects/trustedbsd/openbsm
  cvs -d rwatson@repoman.FreeBSD.org:/home/ncvs -q import src/contrib/openbsm \
        TrustedBSD OPENBSM_1_0_ALPHA_1

Replacing the version string as required.  Use the "-n" argument to CVS to
do a test run.

Right now, no local FreeBSD modification or configuration is required.  In
future OpenBSM versions, this is likely to change.

After importing OpenBSM, make sure to propagate any changes to files that
appear in both contrib/openbsm/bsm and sys/bsm.
