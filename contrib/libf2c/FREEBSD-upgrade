For the import of lib{f,g}2c, files were pruned by:

	tar xvzpf egcs-1.1.2.tar.gz '*/libf2c'

Then imported by:

	cvs import -m "Virgin import of EGCS 1.1.2's libf2c"  \
		src/contrib/libf2c FSF egcs_1_1_2


To make local changes to amd, simply patch and commit to the main
branch (aka HEAD).  Never make local changes on the vendor (FSF) branch.

All local changes should be submitted to "gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org" and/or
David M. Gay <dmg@bell-labs.com> (as libg2c is based on AT&T's netlib
collection).
