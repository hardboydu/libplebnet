Security Fixes

9.6-ESV-R2

   None.

9.6-ESV-R3

     * Adding a NO DATA signed negative response to cache failed to clear
       any matching RRSIG records already in cache. A subsequent lookup of
       the cached NO DATA entry could crash named (INSIST) when the
       unexpected RRSIG was also returned with the NO DATA cache entry.
       [RT #22288] [CVE-2010-3613] [VU#706148]
     * BIND, acting as a DNSSEC validator, was determining if the NS RRset
       is insecure based on a value that could mean either that the RRset
       is actually insecure or that there wasn't a matching key for the
       RRSIG in the DNSKEY RRset when resuming from validating the DNSKEY
       RRset. This can happen when in the middle of a DNSKEY algorithm
       rollover, when two different algorithms were used to sign a zone
       but only the new set of keys are in the zone DNSKEY RRset. [RT
       #22309] [CVE-2010-3614] [VU#837744]

Bug Fixes

9.6-ESV-R2

     * Check that named successfully skips NSEC3 records that fail to
       match the NSEC3PARAM record currently in use. [RT #21868]
     * Worked around a race condition in the cache database memory
       handling. Without this fix a DNS cache DB or ADB could incorrectly
       stay in an over memory state, effectively refusing further caching,
       which subsequently made a BIND 9 caching server unworkable. [RT
       #21818]
     * BIND did not properly handle non-cacheable negative responses from
       insecure zones. This caused several non-protocol-compliant zones to
       become unresolvable. BIND is now more accepting of responses it
       receives from less strict servers. [RT #21555]
     * The resolver could attempt to destroy a fetch context too soon,
       resulting in a crash. [RT #19878]
     * The placeholder negative caching element was not properly
       constructed triggering a crash (INSIST) in dns_ncache_towire(). [RT
       #21346]
     * Handle the introduction of new trusted-keys and DS, DLV RRsets
       better. [RT #21097]
     * Fix arguments to dns_keytable_findnextkeynode() call. [RT #20877]

9.6-ESV-R3

     * Microsoft changed the behavior of sockets between NT/XP based
       stacks vs Vista/windows7 stacks. Server 2003/2008 have the older
       behavior, 2008r2 has the new behavior. With the change, different
       error results are possible, so ISC adapted BIND to handle the new
       error results. This resolves an issue where sockets would shut down
       on Windows servers causing named to stop responding to queries. [RT
       #21906]
     * Windows has non-POSIX compliant behavior in its rename() and
       unlink() calls. This caused journal compaction to fail on Windows
       BIND servers with the log error: "dns_journal_compact failed:
       failure". [RT #22434]
     * 'host -D' now turns on debugging messages earlier. [RT #22361]
     * isc_print_vsnprintf() failed to check if there was space available
       in the buffer when adding a left justified character with a non
       zero width, (e.g. "%-1c"). [RT #22270]
     * view->queryacl was being overloaded. Seperate the usage into
       view->queryacl, view->cacheacl and view->queryonacl. [RT #22114]
     * win32: add more dependencies to BINDBuild.dsw. [RT #22062]
     * win32: named-checkzone and named-checkconf failed to initialise
       winsock. [RT #21932]
     * named failed to generate a correct signed response in a optout,
       delegation only zone with no secure delegations. [RT #22007]

Known issues in this release

     * "make test" will fail on OSX and possibly other operating systems.
       The failure occurs in a new test to check for allow-query ACLs. The
       failure is caused because the source address is not specified on
       the dig commands issued in the test.
       If running "make test" is part of your usual acceptance process,
       please edit the file bin/tests/system/allow_query/test.sh and add
       -b 10.53.0.2
       to the DIGOPTS line.
