GLOBAL

This directory contains virgin sources of the original distribution files on
a "vendor" branch.  Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to upgrade the
files in this directory via patches and a cvs commit.  New versions or
official-patch versions must be imported. 

Before attempting an upgrade, please read the section entitled "Contributed
Software" in the FreeBSD Handbook (from which this file is derived.)  New
releases of the source should be imported onto the vendor branch and merged
with the FreeBSD-customized sources that live on the main branch.

To upgrade to a newer version, when it is available:
        1. Unpack the new version into an empty directory.
           [Do not make ANY changes to the files.]

        2. Remove any files that don't apply to FreeBSD.

        3. Use the command:
                cvs import -m 'Virgin import of GLOBAL v<version>' \
                        src/contrib/global GLOBAL v<version>

        4. Follow the instructions printed out in step 3 to resolve any
           conflicts between local FreeBSD changes and the newer version.

Do not, under any circumstances, deviate from this procedure.

To make local changes, simply patch and commit to the main branch (aka HEAD). 
Never make local changes on the GLOBAL vendor branch.  

Please submit changes to GLOBAL's author, Shigio Yamaguchi
<shigio@wafu.netgate.net> for inclusion in his next release.  The most recent
release of GLOBAL is available at the author's web page:
