Patch for btree(3)
------------------

Btree(3) core dumps on certain data sets.

if (your system == FreeBSD 2.2.6R or former)
	needs this patch.
else if (your system == Debian GNU/Linux 1.3.1)
	needs this patch.
else
	I don't know.

Please apply patch files in this directory.

1. patch your btree(3) source code

	% ls
	patch.1.2       patch.1.3       patch.1.4
	% set dir=`pwd`			<- set current directory
	% cd /usr/src/lib/libc/db	<- your db source code directory
	% cd btree			<- btree library
	% patch < $dir/patch.1.2	<- it must be in this order.
	  .
	  .
	% patch < $dir/patch.1.3
	  .
	  .
	% patch < $dir/patch.1.4
	  .
	  .

2. remake and install your db(3) library.
3. remake GLOBAL.
4. remake tag files because tag files are already corrupted.
