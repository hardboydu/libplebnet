GLOBAL cannot recognize following macros and functions.

1. Macro which doesn't end with ';'.

   GLOBAL cannot recognize func() after M(a), because M(a) seems to be
   function definition.

	#define M(a)	static char *string = a;

	M(a)

	func() {
		...
	}

   It should be follows.

	#define M(a)	static char *string = a

	M(a);

	func() {
		...
	}

2. Macro which is a renamed function.

	#define func _func

	_func() {
		...
	}
	main() {
		func();
	}

   In fact, main() calls _func() instead of func() but GLOBAL cannot
   recognize it.
