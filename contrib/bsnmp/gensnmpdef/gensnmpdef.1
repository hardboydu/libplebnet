.Sh NAME
.Nm gensnmpdef
.Nd "generate a MIB description file from MIBs"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl c Ar cut
.Ar name Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to create an initial MIB description file from
one or more MIBs. The description file must be edited to be actually useful
for feeding it into
.Xr gensnmptree 1 .
.Pp
The
.Fl c
option specifies the number of initial sub-oids that should be omitted
from the tree.
.Xr gensnmptree 1
automatically adds 1.3.6 in front of all OIDs so the default value
of 3 is just correct in most cases.
.Pp
.Nm
does no attempt on sorting the OID tree so in case of complex and
non-standard MIBs it is necessay to sort the tree in the resulting definition
file by hand.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr snmpd 1
.Sh BUGS
The utility is by no means bullet-proof and may fail for complex
or non-standard MIBs.
Its output is expected to be edited by hand.
