	WARNS=6 fixed.

28-Jan-2003
	WARNS=5 fixes.

09-Jan-2003
	snmpd: remove local socket in case of an error to fully initialize it.
	Use chmod instead of fchmod. The latter seems not really to change
	the mode of the socket.

	lib: at program exit remove the local socket in the library.

11-Dec-2002
	Implement listening on unix domain sockets. The client must bind
	its socket, or the server cannot send back its response. These
	sockets are considered to be more secure, because it is much
	harder for an intruder to listen on them.

	This requires changes in snmpmod.h and snmpclient.h.

04-Dec-2002
	Sparc fixes.

15-Aug-2002
	Use inttypes.h instead of limits.h to get integer limits. This
	seems to be the Posix way.

	First drafts of an snmpd, gensnmptree, asn1, bsnmplib,
	bsnmpclient, bsnmpagent, snmpmod, snmp_mibII, snmp_netgraph man pages.

	snmpd/main.c: reorder getopt options according to style(9). Implement
	a -h option to print a short help.

25-Jun-2002
	Makefiles rewritten to not use bsnmpmod.mk. The BSD makefiles are
	really hard to use, because a) they are not documented and b) they
	change much too often.

	Make the patch a context diff instead of a unified one.

28-Feb-2002
	Library code for SNMP clients.
