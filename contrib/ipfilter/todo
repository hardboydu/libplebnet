* automatically use the interface's IP# for NAT rather than any specific IP#

* use fr_tcpstate() with NAT code for increased NAT usage security or even
  fr_checkstate()

* use minor devices for controlling access to alternate parts of IP Filter
  such as filtering, accounting, state, NAT, etc.

* see if the Solaris2 and dynamic plumb/unplumb problem is solvable

time permitting:

* load balancing across interfaces

* record buffering for TCP/UDP

* modular application proxying

* invesitgate making logging better
