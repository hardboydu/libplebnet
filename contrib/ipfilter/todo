* automatically use the interface's IP# for NAT rather than any specific IP#
 - Done. Use "0/32" as destination address/mask.  Uses first interface IP#
   set for an interface.

* use fr_tcpstate() with NAT code for increased NAT usage security or even
  fr_checkstate()

* use minor devices for controlling access to alternate parts of IP Filter
  such as filtering, accounting, state, NAT, etc.

* see if the Solaris2 and dynamic plumb/unplumb problem is solvable

time permitting:

* load balancing across interfaces

* record buffering for TCP/UDP

* modular application proxying

* invesitgate making logging better

* add reverse nat (similar to rdr) to map addresses going in both directions

* add 'tail' switch to ipmon
  (this might just be some changes to rdr).  In 1:1 relationships maybe make
  it an option.
