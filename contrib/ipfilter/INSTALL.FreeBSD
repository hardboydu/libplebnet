To build a kernel for use with the loadable kernel module, follow these
steps:
	1. do "make freebsd"

	2. do "make install-bsd"
	   (probably has to be done as root)

	3.  run "FreeBSD/minstall" as root

	4. build a new kernel

	5. install and reboot with the new kernel

	6. use modload(8) to load the packet filter with:
		modload if_ipl.o

	7. do "modstat" to confirm that it has been loaded successfully.

There is no need to use mknod to create the device in /dev;
- upon loading the module, it will create itself with the correct values,
  under the name (IPL_NAME) from the Makefile.  It will also remove itself
  from /dev when it is modunload'd.

To build a kernel with the IP filter, follow these steps:

	1. do "make freebsd"

	2. do "make install-bsd"
	   (probably has to be done as root)

	3.  run "FreeBSD/kinstall" as root

	4. build a new kernel

	5. create devices for IP Filter as follows (assuming it was
           installed into the device table as char dev 20):
	      mknod /dev/ipl c 20 0
	      mknod /dev/ipnat c 20 1
	      mknod /dev/ipstate c 20 2
	      mknod /dev/ipauth c 20 3

	6. install and reboot with the new kernel
