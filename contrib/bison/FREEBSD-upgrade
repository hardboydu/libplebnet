GNU Bison 1.28

For the import of Bison several directories and files were removed.
The stripped down version was created using FreeBSD-Xlist during extraction:

	tar -X FREEBSD-Xlist -xvzf bison-1.28.tar.gz

Bison 1.28 changes the directory structure from previous releases.
In addition, v1.25 seems to have had a spammed ChangeLog.  Bison v1.26 fixed
this.  Thus the reason 1.28's ChangeLog's are hard to corelate with v1.25's.

To reduce the size of import, and to make it so the changes from 1.25 and
1.28 are easy to determine, the 1.28 directory structure is munged before
import:

	cd bison-1.28
	mv src/ChangeLog ChangeLog.src
	mv src/bison.s1 bison.simple
	mv src/* .
	rmdir src
	mv doc/ChangeLog ChangeLog.doc
	mv -i doc/* .			# answer "no" to all questions
	rm -rf doc


Imported by:

	cvs import -m 'Virgin import of GNU Bison 1.28' \
		src/contrib/bison FSF v1_28


To make local changes to Bison, simply patch and commit to the main
branch (aka HEAD).  Never make local changes on the vendor (FSF) branch.

All local changes should be submitted to the FSF for inclusion in the 
next vendor release.
