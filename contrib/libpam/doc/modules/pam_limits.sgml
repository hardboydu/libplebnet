<sect2>Overview of module

<p>
This module, through the <bf/Linux-PAM/ <em/open/-session hook, sets
limits on the system resources that can be obtained in a
user-session. Its actions are dictated more explicitly through the
configuration file discussed below.

<sect2>Session component

<p>
<descrip>

<tag><bf>Recognized arguments:</bf></tag>
<tt/debug/; <tt>conf=/path/to/file.conf</tt>

<tag><bf>Description:</bf></tag>

Through the contents of the configuration file,
<tt>/etc/security/limits.conf</tt>, resource limits are placed on
users' sessions. Users of <tt/uid=0/ are not affected by this
restriction.

<p>
The behavior of this module can be modified with the following
arguments:
<itemize>

<item><tt/debug/ -
verbose logging to <tt/syslog(3)/.

<item><tt>conf=/path/to/file.conf</tt> -
indicate an alternative <em/limits/ configuration file to the default.

</itemize>

<tag><bf>Examples/suggested usage:</bf></tag>

In order to use this module the system administrator must first create
a <em/root-only-readable/ file (default is
<tt>/etc/security/limits.conf</tt>).  This file describes the resource
limits the superuser wishes to impose on users and groups. No limits
are imposed on <tt/uid=0/ accounts.

<p>
Each line of the configuration file describes a limit for a user in
the form:
<tscreen>
<verb>
<domain>	<type>	<item>		<value>
</verb>
</tscreen>

<p>
The fields listed above should be filled as follows...<newline>
<tt>&lt;domain&gt;</tt> can be:
<itemize>
<item> a username
<item> a groupname, with <tt>@group</tt> syntax
<item> the wild-card <tt/*/, for default entry
</itemize>

<p>
<tt>&lt;type&gt;</tt> can have the two values:
<itemize>

<item> <tt/hard/ for enforcing <em/hard/ resource limits. These limits
are set by the superuser and enforced by the Linux Kernel. The user
cannot raise his requirement of system resources above such values.

<item> <tt/soft/ for enforcing <em/soft/ resource limits. These limits
are ones that the user can move up or down within the permitted range
by any pre-exisiting <em/hard/ limits. The values specified with this
token can be thought of as <em/default/ values, for normal system
usage.

</itemize>

<p>
<tt>&lt;item&gt;</tt> can be one of the following:
<itemize>
<item><tt/core/ - limits the core file size (KB)
<item><tt/data/ - max data size (KB)
<item><tt/fsize/ - maximum filesize (KB)
<item><tt/memlock/ - max locked-in-memory address space (KB)
<item><tt/nofile/ - max number of open files
<item><tt/rss/ - max resident set size (KB)
<item><tt/stack/ - max stack size (KB)
<item><tt/cpu/ - max CPU time (MIN)
<item><tt/nproc/ - max number of processes
<item><tt/as/ - address space limit
<item><tt/maxlogins/ - max number of logins for this user.
</itemize>

<p>
To completely disable limits for a user (or a group), a single dash
(-) will do (Example: ``<tt/bin -/'', ``<tt/@admin -/''). Please
remember that individual limits have priority over group limits, so if
you impose no limits for <tt/admin/ group, but one of the members in this
group have a limits line, the user will have its limits set according
to this line.

<p>
Also, please note that all limit settings are set <em/per login/.
They are not global, nor are they permanent; existing only for the
duration of the session.

<p>
In the <em/limits/ configuration file, the ``<tt/#/'' character
introduces a comment - after which the rest of the line is ignored.

<p>
The <tt/pam_limits/ module does its best to report configuration
problems found in its configuration file via <tt/syslog(3)/.

<p>
The following is an example configuration file:
<tscreen>
<verb>
# EXAMPLE /etc/security/limits.conf file:
# =======================================
# <domain>	<type>	<item>		<value>
*               soft    core            0
*               hard    rss             10000
@student        hard    nproc           20
@faculty        soft    nproc           20
@faculty        hard    nproc           50
ftp             hard    nproc           0
@student        -       maxlogins       4
</verb>
</tscreen>
Note, the use of <tt/soft/ and <tt/hard/ limits for the same resource
(see <tt/@faculty/) -- this establishes the <em/default/ and permitted
<em/extreme/ level of resources that the user can can obtain in a
given service-session.

<p>
For the services that need resources limits (login for example) put a
the following line in <tt>/etc/pam.conf</tt> as the last line for that
service (usually after the pam_unix session line:
<tscreen>
<verb>
#
# Resource limits imposed on login sessions via pam_limits
#
login   session    required     pam_limits.so
</verb>
</tscreen>

</descrip>
