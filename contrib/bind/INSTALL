TODO		-- Have spare time?  Consider contributing to the project!
doc/info/*	-- Platform-dependent build hints

HOW TO BUILD:
-------------
4.9.3 is considerably easier to build than previous releases.  These
are the instructions on how to compile the software.  For information
on how to create your configuration files (resolv.conf, named.boot, and
zone files) see the doc/bog directory and/or get "DNS and BIND" by C.
Liu and P. Albitz from O'Reilly & Associates, Sebastopol, CA, ISBN
0-937175-82-X 1992

Note:	If you maintain a BSD or are otherwise running a 4.4BSD-based system
	and want to integrate BIND into it, check out BSD/README.

1.  (optional) If you are going to compile for multiple platforms, you
can make a symbolic link tree for each platform to save disk space.  To
create a directory called "sun4.dir", do:
	make DST=sun4.dir links
Now "cd sun4.dir" and you can do everything as if you had a complete
copy of the source.  Just be careful if you are modifying a file, make
sure you turn any links into files:
	mv file file.tmp ; cp file.tmp file ; rm file.tmp

2.  Edit "conf/options.h" and turn on any options that you want.  The
defaults are pretty reasonable for most installations.

3.  Edit "Makefile".  Go to the section that describes your operating
system and uncoment it out.  Add any other variables (for example,
I added a line "DISTHELP=/usr/local/lib".)  If in doubt, use the
default!

4.  "make" should build everything.  Consider putting "./bin" in your
path if "make depend" fails and you think bin/mkdep will help you out.

	The next step (#5) will burn down files which were supplied with
	your operating system.  You should run the suggested "-n" first
	and make sure you have saved any files you want to save.

5.  "make install" will install everything.  You might first do
"make -n install" to see what commands would be executed by "make install"
to make sure you understand where everything is about to be installed.

6.  (optional, SunOS 4.1.x/NetBSD-1.x/Solaris 2.x only): You can integrate
the new resolver (client-side) code into the shared libraries of your
operating system so that all dynamicly linked programs take advantage of
the new resolver.  Read shres/<osname>/INSTALL to find out how to do it.
