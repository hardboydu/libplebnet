INTRODUCTION:
-------------
BIND used to be extremely difficult to build.  That changed around
version 4.9.3.  These are the instructions on how to compile the
software.  For information on how to create your configuration files
(resolv.conf, named.boot, and zone files) see the doc/bog directory for
the complete "BIND Operations Guide".  You might also consider getting
"DNS and BIND" by C.  Liu and P.  Albitz from O'Reilly & Associates,
Sebastopol, CA, ISBN 0-937175-82-X 1992

Note:	If you maintain a BSD or are otherwise running a 4.4BSD-based system
	and want to integrate BIND into it, check out BSD/README.

BUILDING & INSTALLING:
----------------------
1.  (optional) If you are going to compile for multiple platforms, you
can make a symbolic link tree for each platform to save disk space.  To
create a directory called "sun4.dir", do:
	make DST=sun4.dir links
Now "cd sun4.dir" and you can do everything as if you had a complete
copy of the source.  Just be careful if you are modifying a file, make
sure you turn any links into files:
	mv file file.tmp ; cp file.tmp file ; rm file.tmp

2. (optional) If you have a typical site, you should find yourself only
editing Makefile and conf/options.h.  Make backups of them now:

	mv conf/options.h conf/options.h.dist
	cp conf/options.h.dist conf/options.h
	chmod u+w conf/options.h

	mv Makefile Makefile.dist
	cp Makefile.dist Makefile
	chmod u+w Makefile

3.  Edit "conf/options.h" and turn on any options that you want.  The
defaults are pretty reasonable for most installations.

4.  Edit "Makefile".  The default build parameters are given for 4.4 BSD. 
They should be overridden (not edited!).  Do this by going to the
section that describes your operating system and uncoment the
appropriate lines.  Add any other variables (for example, some people
add "DISTHELP=/usr/local/lib".)  If in doubt, use the default!  Read
the comments carefully!

5.  "make" should build everything.  Consider putting "./bin" in your
path if "make depend" fails and you think bin/mkdep will help you out.

	*** NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE ***

	The next step (#6) will burn down files which were supplied with
	your operating system.  You should run the suggested "-n" first
	and make sure you have saved any files you want to save.

	*** NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE ***

6.  "make install" will install everything.  You might first do
"make -n install" to see what commands would be executed by "make install"
to make sure you understand where everything is about to be installed.

7.  (optional, SunOS 4, SunOS 5, NetBSD-1.x, IRIX, Linix only): You can
integrate the new resolver (client-side) code into the shared libraries
of your operating system so that all dynamicly linked programs take
advantage of the new resolver.  Read shres/<osname>/INSTALL to find out
how to do it.



HOW TO GET HELP:
----------------
The "bind-users@vix.com" mailing list was created especially for people to
talk about and ask questions about installation, maintenance, etc.  It is
highly recommended that you first help yourself by reading the BOG (doc/bog)
or a book on DNS and BIND.

To be added to this mailing list, send mail to <bind-users-request@vix.com>

Note that the bind-users mailing list is also available on Usenet as
	comp.protocols.dns.bind
and that we would all prefer that you read it that way if you possibly can.
