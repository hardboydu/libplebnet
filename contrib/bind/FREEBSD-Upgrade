$FreeBSD$

1. Create clean import directory.
2. Un-tar bind-{src|doc}.tar.gz.
3. rm Makefile; mv doc src/
   (Don't un-tar doc in src, you'll spam the real Makefile.)
4. while read pattern; do rm -r src/${pattern} ; done < FREEBSD-Xlist
5. find . -name .cvsignore -delete
6. chmod 644 src/LICENSE
7. Create another clean directory.
8. cvs export -rHEAD src/contrib/bind
9. diff -ur the two directories and look for 'Only in' to see if
   there are any new files, or anything gone missing.
10. Once you're satisfied, do the import. Replace version strings appropriately:

cvs import -m"Import of ISC BIND version 8.3.3" src/contrib/bind ISC v8_3_3

11. Resolve conflicts as needed.


Note: bin/nslookup/commands.l needs a different patch for the command line
      editing customization in -current and RELENG_4.
