This is the source portion of BIND version 8.1.2.  Its companions are
"doc" and "contrib" so you are probably not missing anything.

See the CHANGES file for a detailed listing of all changes.  See the INSTALL
file for information on building and installing BIND 8.1.2.


BIND 8.1.2 Highlights

	Security fixes for a number of problems including:

		An attacker could overwrite the stack if inverse query support
		was enabled.

		A number of denial of service attacks where malformed packets
		could cause the server to crash.

		The server was willing to answer queries on its forwarding
		sockets.

	Several memory leaks have been plugged.

	The server no longer panics if a periodic interface scan fails due
	to no file descriptors being available.

	Updates to a number of ports.  New ports for QNX, LynxOS, HP-UX 9.x,
	and HP MPE.

	"files unlimited" now works as expected on systems where setting
	an infinite rlim_max for RLIMIT_NOFILE works.

	Adding and deleting the same record in the same dynamic update no
	longer crashes the server.

	If a dynamic update fails, rollback is now done in LIFO order instead
	of FIFO order.

	Better behavior when priming of the root servers fails.

	purge_zone() didn't work correctly for the root zone, allowing
	old data to persist after loading the zone.

	Improved handling of oversized UDP packets.

	All hosts on the also-notify list are now notified.

	The meaning of the count returned by select() varies somewhat by
	operating system, and this could cause previous releases of the
	server to spin.

	Per-host statistics may be disabled by specifying 'host-statistics no'
	in named.conf.

	The maximum number of zones has been increased from 32768 to 65536.

	query-source may specify an address and port that the server is
	already listening on.  BIND 8.1.1 required that either the address
	or port be wild.  E.g., you can now say:

		listen-on port 53 { 10.0.0.1; };
		query-source address 10.0.0.1 port 53;

	The value of FD_SETSIZE to use may be specified.

	Experimental -u (set user id), -g (set group id), and -t (chroot)
	command line options.  See the INSTALL file for details.

To Support the Effort

	Note that BIND is supported by the Internet Software Consortium, and
	although it is free for use and redistribution and incorporation into
	vendor products and export and anything else you can think of, it
	costs money to produce.  That money comes from ISPs, hardware and
	software vendors, companies who make extensive use of the software,
	and generally kind hearted folk such as yourself.

	The Internet Software Consortium has also commissioned a DHCP server
	implementation, has taken over official support/release of the INN
	system, and supports the Kerberos Version 5 effort at MIT.  You can
	learn more about the ISC's goals and accomplishments from the web page
	at <URL:http://www.isc.org/>.
