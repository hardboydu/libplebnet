If you have not built libpcap, do so first.  See the README
file in this directory for the ftp location.

You will need an ANSI C compiler to build tcpdump. The configure script
will abort if your compiler is not ANSI compliant. If this happens, use
the GNU C compiler, available via anonymous ftp:

	ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gcc-*.tar.gz

After libpcap has been built (either install it with "make install" and
"make install-incl" or make sure both the libpcap and tcpdump source
trees are in the same directory), edit the BINDEST and MANDEST paths in
Makefile.in and run ./configure (a shell script).  "configure" will
determine your system attributes and generate an appropriate Makefile
from Makefile.in.  Now build tcpdump by running "make".

If everything builds ok, su and type "make install" (and optionally
"make install-man). This will install tcpdump and the manual entry. By
default, tcpdump is installed with group execute permissions. The group
used depends on your os. In addition, BPF packet access is controlled
by permissions to /dev/bpf0. In any case, DO NOT give untrusted users
the capability of running tcpdump. Tcpdump can capture any traffic on
your net, including passwords.

Note that tcpdump is shipped with some systems, for example, DEC/OSF
and BSD/386.  Remember to remove or rename the installed binary
when upgrading.

If your system is not one which we have tested tcpdump on, you may have
to modify the configure script and Makefile.in. Please send us patches
for any modifications you need to make. However, we are not interested
in ascii packet printer patches. We believe adding this feature would
make it too easy for crackers who do not have the programming skills
needed to write a password sniffer to grab clear text passwords.
