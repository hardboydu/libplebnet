CVS has RCS Id, Name and Header tags. It needs to be imported with -ko.

It is imported from it's top level directory something like this:
  cvs -n import -ko src/contrib/cvs CYCLIC v<version>

The -n option is "dont do anything" so you can see what is about to happen
first.  Remove it when it looks ok.

The initial import was done with:
  cvs import -ko src/contrib/cvs CYCLIC v1_8_1

When new versions are imported, cvs will give instructions on how to merge
the local and vendor changes when/if conflicts arise..

The developers can be reached at:  <devel-cvs@cyclic.com>.  Local changes
that are suitable for public consumption should be submitted for inclusion
in future releases.
