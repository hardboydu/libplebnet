$FreeBSD$

To strip down a new version of GNU binutils for import, extract
the files like this:

    tar -xvzf binutils-2.10.1.tar.gz -X FREEBSD-Xlist
    tar -xvzf binutils-2.10.1.tar.gz include/elf

Don't eliminate the *z8* files.  They're needed because of a stupid
hard-coded configure script in the opcodes subdirectory.

If you decide to bring in more of the files, import them -- don't
use ``cvs add''.  And please remember to adjust the contents of
`FREEBSD-Xlist' so that it reflects what is really imported from
the vendor.

The vendor import was done by:

	cvs import src/contrib/binutils GNU binutils_2_10_1

Note that many of the files generated by GNU configure are present pre-built
in the "src/gnu/usr.bin/binutils" tree.  These can be regenerated for a new
version of binutils by running the "update.sh" script in that directory.

When upgrading to a new version, you also need to update the VERSION
definition in "src/gnu/usr.bin/binutils/Makefile.inc0".
