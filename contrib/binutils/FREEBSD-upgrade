To strip down a new version of GNU binutils for import, extract
the files like this:

    tar -xvzf binutils-2.8.1.tar.gz -X FREEBSD-Xlist

Don't eliminate the *z8* files.  They're needed because of a stupid
hard-coded configure script in the opcodes subdirectory.

If you decide to bring in more of the files, import them -- don't
use "cvs add".  And please remember to adjust the contents of
"FREEBSD-Xlist" so that it reflects what is really imported from
the vendor.

Many of the files generated by GNU configure are present pre-built in
the "src/gnu/usr.bin/binutils" tree.  These can be regenerated for a
new version of binutils by running the "update.sh" script in that
directory.

When upgrading to a new version, you also need to update the VERSION
definition in "src/gnu/usr.bin/binutils/Makefile.inc0".
