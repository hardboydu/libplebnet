GNU Texinfo 4.1
	originals can be found at: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/


For the import of Texinfo many files and directories were pruned by:

	tar -X FREEBSD-Xlist -xzf texinfo-4.1.tar.gz


To reduce the size of import, and to make it so the changes from 3.12
to 4.1 are easy to determine, the 4.1 directory structure was munged
before import:

	cd texinfo-4.1
	mv config.in config.h.in


Then imported by:

	cvs import -m 'Import of stripped down GNU texinfo 4.1' \
		src/contrib/texinfo FSF v4_1

After the import, a separate extraction of texinfo was GNU configured
in the "normal" way.  The resulting config.h file should be compared
with src/contrib/texinfo/config.h, and src/contrib/texinfo/config.h
updated as needed.

To make local changes to texinfo, simply patch and commit to the main
branch (aka HEAD).  Never make local changes on the vendor (FSF) branch.

All local changes should be submitted to the FSF for inclusion in the
next vendor release.
