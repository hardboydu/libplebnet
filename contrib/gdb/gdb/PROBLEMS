			Known problems in GDB 5.2

		See also: http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/bugs/


hppa2.0-hp-hpux10.20
--------------------

gdb/487: The top level make files used to build GDB are not compatible
with HP/UX make.  As a workaround, use GNU make.

gdb/486: The HP/UX C compiler defaults to K&R mode but GDB only builds
with an ISO C compiler.  The top level configuration incorrectly sets
CC to `cc' instead of `cc -Ae'.  As a workaround, the correct compiler
can be specified as part of the configuration vis:

    $  'CC=cc -Ae' ./configure


s390*-*-*
---------

gdb/513: GDB does not build on s390 GNU/Linux.  The problem should be
fixed in more recent sources.


i386-*-freebsd4.4*
------------------

gdb/455: GDB doesn't build on a FreeBSD 4.4-STABLE system.  The
problem is still being investigated.
