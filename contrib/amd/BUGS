	    LIST OF KNOWN BUGS IN AM-UTILS OR OPERATING SYSTEMS


(1) mips-sgi-irix*

[1A] known to have flakey NFS V.3 and TCP.  Amd tends to hang or spin
infinitely after a few hours or days of use.  Users must install recommended
patches from vendor.  Patches help, but not all the time.  Otherwise avoid
using NFS V.3 and TCP on these systems, by setting

	/defaults opts:=vers=2,proto=udp

[1B] yp_all() leaks a file descriptor.  Eventually amd runs out of file
descriptors and hangs.  Am-utils circumvents this by using its own version
of yp_all which uses udp and iterats over NIS maps.  The latter isn't as
reliable as yp_all() which uses TCP, but it is better than hanging.


(2) alpha-unknown-linux-gnu (RedHat Linux 4.2)

hasmntopt(mnt, opt) can goes into an infinite loop if opt is any substring
of mnt->mnt_opts.  Redhat 5.0 does not have this libc bug.  Here is an
example program:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <mntent.h>
main()
{
  struct mntent mnt;
  char *cp;
  mnt.mnt_opts = "intr,rw,port=1023,timeo=8,foo=br,retrans=110,indirect,map=/usr/local/AMD/etc/amd.proj,boo";
  cp = hasmntopt(&mnt, "ro");
  printf("cp = %s\n", cp);
  exit(0);
}


(3) mips-dec-ultrix4.3

Rainer Orth <ro@TechFak.Uni-Bielefeld.DE> reports

[3A] At least the gcc 2.7.0 fixincludes-mangled <sys/utsname.h> needs a
forward declaration of struct utsname to avoid lots of gcc warnings:

RCS file: RCS/utsname.h,v

[3B] It autoconfigures and compiles cleanly, but currently hangs after a
couple of hours without leaving any traces in the syslog output.


(4) powerpc-ibm-aix4.2.1.0

[4A] "Randall S. Winchester" <rsw@Glue.umd.edu> reports that for amd to
start, you need to kill and restart rpc.mountd and possibly also make sure
that nfsd is running.  Normally these are not required.

[4B] "Stefan Vogel" <vogel@physik.unizh.ch> reports that if your amq
executable dump core unexpectedly, then it may be a bug in gcc 2.7.x.
Upgrade to gcc 2.8.x or use IBM's xlC compiler.
