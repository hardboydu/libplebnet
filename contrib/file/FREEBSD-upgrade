Christos Zoulas `file'
	originals can be found at: ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/file/

Imported by:

	cvs import -m 'Virgin import of Christos Zoulas's FILE 3.33.' \
		src/contrib/file ZOULAS file_3_33


Never make local changes to ZOULAS `file'.  Christos is very willing to
work with us to meet our FreeBSD needs.  Thus submit any desired changes
to him <> and wait for the next release and vendor import to get them.
