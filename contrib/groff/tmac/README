The file `hyphen.us' is identical to the file `hyphen.tex', part of the TeX
system written by Donald E. Knuth; the master file can be found at

  ftp://labrea.stanford.edu/pub/tex/dist/lib/hyphen.tex    .

It has been renamed for consistency, i.e., to make patterns available under
the filenames `hyphen.<language>', e.g. `hyphen.de' or `hyphen.uk'.

From the file ftp://labrea.stanford.edu/tex/README; `hyphen.tex' is also in
this directory:

  The files in this directory are master files maintained personally by
  Donald E. Knuth.  Nobody else is authorized to make any changes whatever
  to them!  If you modify the files for any purpose, you must give your
  files a different name, so that installations of TeX throughout the
  world will be 100% compatible when they use the official source files.

  All of the files here are available for anonymous FTP by anyone and may
  be freely redistributed.  Some are copyrighted; see the files themselves
  for more details.
