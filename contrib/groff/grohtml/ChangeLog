2000-06-17  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@is.elta.co.il>

	* html.cc [!_POSIX_VERSION]: Include limits.h and dirent.h or
	sys/dir.h.  Define NAME_MAX using MAXNAMLEN.  Include nonposix.h.
	(file_name_max): New function.
	(html_printer::make_new_image_name): If the filesystem doesn't
	support file names longer than 14 characters, use a shorter
	image_name string.
	(html_printer::convert_to_image): Enlarge the size of buffer[] to
	accomodate 2 temp file names plus some slack.  Don't put \n at the
	end of commands passed to system().  Redirect stderr to the null
	device programmatically, not via the shell.  Use NULL_DEV, not
	literal "/dev/null".  Print diagnostics if any calls to system()
	failed.

2000-05-31  Keith Thompson  <kst@SDSC.EDU>

	* html.cc: Added declaration of mktemp() as needed for SunOS 4.1.3.

2000-05-11  Werner LEMBERG  <wl@gnu.org>

	* output.cc (simple_output::simple_output): Reordering of
	initializers to remove compiler warning.

2000-04-28  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* html.cc (calculate_margin): Calculate the left and right margin
	irrespective of the boolean `margin_on'.  Fixes a divide by zero bug
	and a column bug as reported by Steve Blinkhorn <steve@prd.co.uk>.
	Improved the behaviour of the -m (margin on) option.

	* html.cc (make_html_indent): More checking.

	* html.cc (right_indentation): Fixed substitution slip-up.

	compilers.

2000-03-01  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	spotted by Werner.
	
2000-02-11  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

2000-02-07  Colin Phipps  <crp22@cam.ac.uk>

	creating files in /tmp.

2000-02-06  Werner LEMBERG  <wl@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.sub: Adapted to new directory structure.

2000-01-28  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* html.cc: Minor fixes.

2000-01-27  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* html.cc: Added support for the new tcommand `F'.
	* TODO: Updated.
	
2000-01-24  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	Fixes to manual page handling, font changes, spaces, and
	diacritical characters.  All *standard* html character encodings
	are handled.
	
	Added -T option which turns off all image generation for tables. 
	One day grohtml should be able to determine this for itself.

	Altered image name to: <groff_input_file>-<index>.png as per
	Werners suggestion.

	* grohtml.man: Document -T option.

	* html_chars.h: New file, providing diacritical table support.

	declaration.

1999-12-28  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* html.cc: Revisited the table handling code with a vengeance,
	aiming to make manual pages generate sensible html.
	Superscripting/subscripting revisited.  Fixed wierd table lengths.
	Table widths are now specified in percentages.  Fixed the man.n
	test example which Werner reported.

Version 1.15 released
=====================

1999-12-21  Werner LEMBERG  <wl@gnu.org>

	* grohtml.man: Fixed copyright year.

1999-12-15  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* html.cc: Some other fixes.

1999-12-13  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* html.cc (main): Added new option `-x' to help debugging tables.

1999-12-11  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* html.cc: Fixed image position bugs.  However, three major bugs
	remain: Firstly, grohtml sometimes miscalculates the end of an
	html table resulting in text which appears twice.  Secondly,
	equation numbers are not handled correctly.  Thirdly, equation
	macros and pic macros can confuse grohtml; this can be seen by
	nested `graphic-start's -- I believe the best method to solve this
	is to detect .EQ, .EN, .TS, .TE, .PS, .PE sequences in troff and
	add the graphic-start special character at this point.

	* grohtml.man: Minor fixes.
	
1999-11-29  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* design.ms: More updates; added some basic introductional
	information.

	* html.cc: Fixed more bugs mainly in the table handling code.
	Making the code terminate a table at the correct position.
	Indented .IPs appear to work now.  Region ends also correctly
	terminate tables.

1999-11-16  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* design.ms, grohtml.man: Updated.

	* html.cc, ordered_list.h: Fixed many bugs in the table handling
	code.  Reverted the -t switch so that table handling code is used
	by default and users must turn it off with -t.

	Manual page generation using `groff -Thtml -man' is much better
	due in large part to the table code and minor alterations in
	tmac.an.

1999-10-30  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* implemented auto formatting and introduced html table
	code. Fixed several text handling bugs and grohtml will
	detect centered lines - an offshoot of the html table code.

	* reverted meaning of grohtml's `-a' switch: using -a means that
	output will be preformatted.

1999-10-05  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* Introduced command line options -r to determine the resolution
	of generated images, -I to determine the format of images
	generated.

	* Fixed many bugs to do with superscripts, subscripts,
	indentation, font changes, and extraneous spaces.

	* Fixed bug in determining the range of polygons and splines.

	* Updated the manual page to reflect the new options.

	* The default image type is png format, however this will only
	work if you have a gs with a png output device.  If you don't have
	a gs with this ability you can either reconfigure html to generate
	gif images by default (alter a #define in html.cc).  Or
	alternatively you can use the -Igif option.

1999-09-27  Werner LEMBERG  <wl@gnu.org>

	* html.cc (move_horizontal): Fonts have changed one character too
	late.
	
1999-09-26  Werner LEMBERG  <wl@gnu.org>

	* grohtml.man: Minor cosmetic fixes.

1999-09-25  Gaius Mulley <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* grohtml.man, html.cc: Rewrite of the html text component.  Basic
	font faces supported together with font types.  Superscript and
	subscript have also been implemented.  Temporarily removed the
	-P-a switch on grohtml as it is not working (never worked).  This
	is the next `to do'.  Added a simple macro tmac.arkup which
	contains simple html features.  This macro needs further work.
	Arc, spline, polygon fill have all been added and arc max/min xy
	limits are calculated, the same needs to be done for spline.  Many
	bugs have been fixed regarding basic html text.

	* design.ms: New file describing how html.cc works.

Aug 1999

	Initial release, very basic html text generated, quite ugly text
	is generated according to many reports :-) Equations, tables,
	pictures generate gif files via gs and ppmquant, ppmtogif, grops.
