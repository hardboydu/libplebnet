This file describes recent user-visible changes in groff.  Bug fixes
are not described.  There are more details in the man pages.

Groff
-----

o `-mFOO' will now search first for `FOO.tmac' and then for `tmac.FOO'.  The
  old behaviour has been changed to overcome problems with platforms which
  have an 8+3 file name limit, and platforms which have other versions of
  troff installed also. Additionally, all macro files have been renamed
  using the latter scheme to avoid 8+3 name clashes.

o The new environment variable GROFF_BIN_PATH will be checked for programs
  groff is calling (preprocessors, troff, and output devices) before PATH.
  If not set, it defaults to the directory where the groff binary is
  located.  Previously, it was PATH only.  The nroff script will only use
  GROFF_BIN_PATH to find the groff binary but passes both the GROFF_BIN_PATH
  and PATH environment variable to groff.

Troff
-----

o The mdoc package has been completely rewritten, using the full power of
  GNU troff to remove limitations of Unix troff (which is no longer
  supported).  Most important changes are:

  . No argument limit.
  . Almost all macros are parsed and callable (if it makes sense).
  . `.Lb': prints library names
  . `.Nm <punctuation>' now works as expected; `.Nm "" <punctuation>' has
    been withdrawn.
  . Updated `.St' command
  . `.Fx': prints FreeBSD
  . `.Ox': prints OpenBSD
  . `.Bsx': prints BSD/OS
  . `.Brq', `.Bro', `.Brc': brace enclosure macros
  . `.Bd -centered': center lines
  . `.Bl -xwidth <string>': interpret <string> and use the resulting width
  . support for double-sided printing (-rD1 command line switch)
  . support for 11pt and 12pt document sizes (-rS11, -rS12 command line
    switches)

  `groff_mdoc.man' replaces `groff_mdoc.samples.man'; it now completely
  documents the mdoc package.

  Great care has been taken to assure backwards compatibility.  If you
  encounter any abnormal results, please report them to bug-groff@gnu.org.

o A new command line option for the `man' macros (similar to the `mdoc'
  package has been implemented: `-rcR=1' (now the default in nroff mode) will
  produce one single, very long page instead of multiple pages.  `-rcR=0'
  will deactivate it.

o The `return' request has been added to return immediately from a macro.

o A new request `nop' (no operation) has been added which is similar to
  `if 1'.  For example,

    .if t \{\
    Hallo!
    .\}

  can now be written as

    .if t \{\
    .  nop Hallo!
    .\}

o `box' and `boxa' are two new requests which behave similarly to `di' and
  `da' but don't include a partially filled line (which is restored after
  ending the diversion).

o The `asciify' request has been extended to `unformat' space characters
  and some other escape sequences also.

  `\ ' will no longer be unformatted as a space but remains an unpaddable,
  unbreakable space character.

o The new `unformat' request is similar to `asciify' but only handles space
  characters and tabs specially if the diversion is reread, retaining font
  information.  This makes it possible to reformat diversions; for example
  the following

    .ll 3i
    .
    a01 a02 a03 a04 a05 a06 a07 a08 a09 a10.
    .
    .box box1
    .ev 1
    .nf
    \f[B]b01 b02 b03 b04 b05 b06 b07 b08 b09 b10.\f[P]
    .br
    .ev
    .box
    .
    c01 c02 c03 c04 c05 c06 c07 c08 c09 c10.
    .
    .unformat box1
    .box1

  gives

    a01  a02  a03  a04 a05 a06 a07
    a08 a09 a10.  c01 c02 c03  c04
    c05  c06 c07 c08 c09 c10.  b01
    b02 b03 b04 b05  b06  b07  b08
    b09 b10.

  Without the `unformat' request, space characters are converted to word
  space nodes which are no longer stretchable, and the result would be

    a01  a02  a03  a04 a05 a06 a07
    a08 a09 a10.  c01 c02 c03  c04
    c05  c06 c07 c08 c09 c10.  b01
    b02 b03 b04 b05 b06 b07 b08
    b09 b10.

o The new request `linetabs' controls the `line-tabs' mode.  In line-tabs
  mode, tab distances are computed relative to the (current) output line.
  Otherwise they are taken relative to the input line.  For example, the
  following

    .ds x a\t\c
    .ds y b\t\c
    .ds z c
    .ta 1i 3i
    \*x
    \*y
    \*z

  yields

    a         b         c

  In line-tabs mode, the same code gives

    a         b                   c

  The new read-only number register `.linetabs' returns 1 if in line-tabs
  mode, and 0 otherwise.

o Two new requests `tm1' and `tmc' have been added to improve writing
  messages to the terminal.  `tm1' is similar to `tm' but allows leading
  whitespace.  `tmc' is similar to `tm1' but doesn't emit a final newline.

o A new request `dei' (define indirect) has been added.  The first and
  second parameter of `dei' are taken from string registers rather than
  directly; this very special request is needed to make `trace.tmac'
  independent from the escape character (which might even be disabled).

o It is now possible to save and restore the escape character with two new
  requests `ecs' and `ecr'.

o The new escape sequence \B'...' is an analogon to `\A': If the string
  within the delimiters is a valid numeric expression, return character `1',
  and `0' otherwise.

o The new escape sequence `\:' inserts a zero-width break point.  This is
  similar to `\%' but without a soft hyphen character.

o The `tr' request can now map characters onto `\~'.

o Calling the `fam' request without an argument switches back to the
  previous font family.

o The new read-only register `.int' is set to a positive value if the last
  output line is interrupted (i.e., if it contains `\c').

o The `writem' request is not new, but hasn't been documented before.  This
  is similar to `write' but instead of a string the contents of a given
  macro or string is written to a stream.

o The read/write number register `hp' to get/set the current horizontal
  position relative to the input line isn't new but hasn't been documented
  properly before.

o `\X' and `\Y' are no transparent for end-of-sentence recognition.

o The `cu' request in nroff mode now works as documented (i.e., it does
  underline spaces also).

Nroff
-----

Option -v shows the version number.

Grog
----

o The grog script will now work in non-compatibility mode also (which is the
  default).  As usual, use the `-C' option to activate compatibility mode.

o Option -v shows the version number.

Grops
-----

A new option `-P' resp. a new environment variable `GROPS_PROLOGUE' has been
added to select a different prologue file.

The effect of the former `-mpsnew' option to access more Type 1 characters
is now the default and no longer available.  To get the old behaviour (i.e.,
emulation of some glyphs by composition) use `-mpsold'.

Miscellaneous
-------------

o For security reasons the following changes have been done:

  . The tmac.safer file has been replaced with a built-in solution; .open,
    .opena, .pso, .sy, and .pi are completely disabled in safer mode (which
    is the default); to enable these requests the `-U' command line flag
    must be used.

  . Files specified with the .mso request or given with the `-m' command
    line option, and hyphenation patterns loaded with `.hpf' are no longer
    searched in the current directory by default (besides the usual tmac
    path). Instead, the home directory is used. To add the current
    directory, either use the `-U' or `-M' command line option or set the
    GROFF_TMAC_PATH environment variable to an appropriate value.

  . troffrc, troffrc-end, and eqnrc are neither searched in the current nor
    in the home directory (even if -U is given).  Use -M or GROFF_TMAC_PATH
    to change that.

  . Similarly, the current directory is no longer part of the font path.
    Use the `-F' command line option or the GROFF_FONT_PATH environment
    variable if you really need the current directory.

o groff will now install its data files into
  /usr/local/share/groff/<version> by default, following the GNU standard.
  Additionally, a local tmac directory (by default
  /usr/local/share/groff/site-tmac) will be scanned before the standard tmac
  directory.  Wrapper files for system-specific macro packages (if
  necessary) are put into /usr/local/lib/groff/site-tmac; this directory
  will be searched before the local tmac directory.

o All programs now have option `-v' to show the version number; they will
  exit immediately afterwards, following the GNU standards.  Additionally,
  `--version' and `--help' have been added, doing the obvious actions.

VERSION 1.16.1
==============

Bug fixes only; no user-visible changes.

VERSION 1.16
============

Groff
-----

The anachronism of calling the man macro package with `-man' has been fixed;
now you can say `-m man' also. The same is true for `ms', `me', `markup',
`mandoc', and `mdoc'.

A new switch `-g' for calling `grn' is available.

A new switch `-G' for calling `grap' is available.

EBCDIC support for tty devices has been added.  On such hosts, IBM code page
1047 is available with -Tcp1047 instead of -Tascii and -Tlatin1 (and, for
the moment, -Tutf8).  Note that non-tty devices are not yet supported (but
installed).

Troff
-----

A new command line option to the `man' macros is available: `-rSxx' (with
`xx' either 10, 11, or 12) to set the base document font size to `xx'
points.  Additionally, `.SH' now produces larger headings than `.SS'.

To solve a problem with the .PSPIC macro which needs the `-U' switch of
troff to access an external program (psbb), a new request .psbb is now
available to get the bounding box of a PostScript image file.  The values
(in PostScript units) are returned in the new read-only number registers
`llx', `lly', `urx', and `ury'.  Consequently, .PSPIC has been adapted to
use the new request, and the psbb program has been removed.

A new predefined writable number register, `year', has been added.  It
contains the current year.

A new read-only register, `.Y', has been added.  It contains the revision
number of the groff package.

`\fP' now behaves as expected in situations like the following where the
font `foo' is undefined:

  .B bold text
  normal text \f[foo]bar\fP normal text

Previously, the text after \fP appeared as bold.

The `substring' request is not new, but hasn't been documented before.

The predefined `.T' string register (which holds the current output device)
is not new, but hasn't been documented before.

A new request `length' computes the length of a string and returns it in
a number register.

The macro files `tmac.a4' (for specifying A4 paper format) and `tmac.trace'
(a debugging aid) are now installed also.

A new resource file, `troffrc-end', is now available.  It is invoked after
all user-specified macros.  Currently used by the html device to include
tmac.html; thus no need for users to specify -mhtml anymore.

The soft hyphen character now has a glyph name: `shc'.

The latin-1 character 173 (PS name `periodcentered') has got the troff glyph
name `pc' and is no longer intermixed with the symbol character `md' (PS
name `mathdot').

ASCII character 34 (PS name `quotedbl') has got the troff glyph name `dq'
(which is an alias to character `"').

ASCII character 39 (PS name `quoteright') has got the troff glyph name `cq'
(which is an alias to character "'").

Some additions to the font description files have been implemented for
better support of HTML output:

  The new format of lines in the `charset' subsection of font description
  files is

     name metrics type code [entity_name] [-- comment]

  Currently, only the font description files in devhtml use the optional
  entity_name string to define glyph entities in HTML.  Everything after the
  entity_name field is ignored; in case this field isn't used, two hyphen
  characters are now necessary to start a comment.

  Two new requests are available in DESC files (currently used only with
  grohtml):

    use_charnames_in_special
      This command indicates that troff should encode named characters
      inside special commands.

    pass_filenames
      requests that troff tells the driver the source file name being
      processed.  This is achieved by another tcommand: `F filename'.

Grotty
------

Bruno Haible <haible@clisp.cons.org> contributed support for UTF8 output.

Grohtml
-------

Added .LINE macro to tmac.arkup.

The obsolete `.LINK' macro has been removed.

.URL, .FTP, and .MAILTO macros now accept an optional third argument which
will be immediately appended to the second argument (to be used with
punctuation, for example).

Grodvi
------

The font size 11pt has been changed to 10.95pt (as used in LaTeX 2e).

A new font file CWI (using cmitt10; this is typewriter italic) has been
added.

Grolbp
------

A new driver for Canon CAPSL printers (LBP-4 and LBP-8 series laser
printers).  This code has been contributed by Francisco Andres Verdu
<pandres@dragonet.es>.

Grn
---

A new preprocessor to process gremlin pictures.  It is based on the
original Berkeley implementation of grn, written by David Slattengren
and Barry Roitblat, and has been adapted to groff by Daniel Senderowicz
<daniel@synchrods.com> and Werner Lemberg <wl@gnu.org>.

Pic
---

Added the `srand' command to set the seed for a new sequence of
pseudo-random numbers to be returned by `rand'.

Gxditview
---------

Simplified installation: The Imakefile will now be configured (by groff's
configure script).

Documentation
-------------

Three new man pages are available: groff_tmac.5 (documenting how troff macros
are accessed and where they are found), groff.7 (a short reference of the GNU
roff language), and roff.7 (a general survey on GNU troff).

Miscellaneous
-------------

A port to win32 (for use with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0) is now part of the
distribution.  It has been contributed by Blake McBride
<blake@florida-software.com>.

More information about programs, macros, documentation, etc., which is
related to groff has been collected in the file `MORE.STUFF'.

VERSION 1.13, 1.14, 1.15
========================

Bug fixes only; no user-visible changes.

VERSION 1.12
============

Finally, there are new maintainers for groff.  Mailing lists and a CVS
repository are available also.  See the file README for details.  Not
all reported bug could be fixed, so please send mails again if
something is still not working.

Most of the installation problems should have vanished now (most
notably the $(tmac_wrap) bug).

There is now a man page called groff_man.man which documents the
basics of the -man macros.  It has been originally written by Susan
G. Kleinmann <sgk@debian.org>.

A (still incomplete) groff reference manual in texinfo format
originally contributed by Trent A. Fisher <trent@gnurd.portland.or.us>.

me.man and msafer.man have been renamed to groff_me.man
resp. groff_msafer.man for consistency.

Default strings for macros in doc-common resp. tmac.an no longer
contain the word `UNIX'.

groff should now be Y2k safe (fixes contributed by Paul Eggert
<eggert@twinsun.com>).

Following the GNU standards, groff will now use the prefix
`/usr/local/' as the default instead of replacing an existent groff
binary.

groff, troff, nroff, and pic now support the -U flag to activate unsafe
behaviour (without -msafer); the -S flag for using the -msafer macros
is now the default.

Grohtml
-------

This is a new output device for producing HTML output contributed by
Gaius Mulley <gaius@glam.ac.uk>.  It is still very alpha but has been
included into the distribution so that a lot of people have a chance
to test it.  Bug reports are highly welcome.

Grolj4
------

Duplex printing support has been contributed by Jeffrey Copeland
<jeff@opennt.com>.

Soelim
------

Added -I option for defining include paths (patch contributed by Peter
Miller <peterm@jna.com.au>).

Gxditview
---------

Fallback resources added (patch contributed by Larry Jones
<larry.jones@sdrc.com>).

Will now support 8 gray levels.

mm
--

New version 1.32 (contributed by Joergen Haegg <jh@axis.com>).

VERSION 1.11
============

Complete documentation for pic is now in the file doc/pic.ms.  It was
contributed by Eric S. Raymond, <esr@thyrsus.com>, who is emphatically
*not* volunteering to take over groff as he is way overworked with
half a dozen other projects.

VERSION 1.10
============

The directory where data files are installed has been changed from
/usr/local/lib/groff to /usr/local/share/groff to comply with the
latest GNU coding standards.

By default groff programs with Unix equivalents are installed with a
"g" prefix unless there is an existing (non-groff) troff installation.

A new approach is used to make system macro packages available to
groff.  Instead of simply including /usr/lib/tmac in the list of
directories searched by groff, the installation process creates for
each system macro package a wrapper macro package in the groff macro
directory that references the system macro package.  The groff macro
packages are now installed with a leading "g" prefix if there is a
system version of the same macro package, and otherwise without the
"g" prefix, with the exception that the groff version of -me which is
always installed as -me.

There is a new device, lj4, for the HP LaserJet 4 (and PCL5
compatibles).

Groff
-----

groff has a -S option that prevents the use of unsafe features in pic
and troff.  This uses a new -S option of pic and the -msafer macros
for troff.

Troff
-----

The `blm' request specifies a macro to be invoked when a blank line is
encountered.

Pic
---

A -S (safer) option disables the sh command.

Grops
-----

The -m option enables manual feed.

VERSION 1.09
============

\(rn will now produce a character that has the traditional metrics,
and will form corners with \(ul and \(br.  This means that it will not
align properly with \(sr.  Instead there's a new character
\[radicalex] which aligns with \(sr; this is used by eqn for doing
square roots.

Troff
-----

The `pso' request allows you to read from the standard output of a
command.

Grops
-----

The PSPIC macro has options to allow the horizontal alignment of the
graphic to be specified.

VERSION 1.08
============

Troff
-----

The escape sequence \V[xxx] will interpolate the value of the
environment variable xxx.

Tbl
---

The decimalpoint option can be used to specify the character to be
recognized as the decimal point character in place of the default
period.

VERSION 1.07
============

Groff
-----

The environment variable GROFF_COMMAND_PREFIX can be used to control
whether groff looks for `gtroff' or `troff' (similarily for the
preprocessors.)

Troff
-----

Multilingual hyphenation is supported by new `hpf' and `hla' requests,
and by a `\n[.hla]' number register.  The -H option has been removed.
Files of hyphenation patterns can have comments.

When a font cannot be found, troff gives a warning (of type `font',
enabled by default) instead of an error.

There's a new request `trnt' that's like `tr' except that it doesn't
apply to text transparently throughput into a diversion with \!.

Tbl
---

There is a `nokeep' option which tells tbl not to use diversions to
try to keep the table on one page.

Eqn
---

Setting the parameter `nroff' to a non-zero value causes `ndefine' to
behave like `define' and `tdefine' to be ignored.  This is done by
eqnrc when the current device is ascii or latin1.  There's a `neqn'
script that just does `eqn -Tascii'.

Grotty
------

grotty uses whatever page length was specified using the `pl' request
rather than using the paperlength command in the DESC file.  The
paperwidth command in the DESC file is also ignored.

VERSION 1.06
============

The programs in groff that have Unix counterparts can now be installed
without a leading `g' prefix.  See the `g' variable in the Makefile.

The g?nroff script simulates the nroff command using groff.

New special characters \(+h, \(+f, \(+p, \(Fn, \(Bq, \(bq, \(aq, \(lz,
\(an.  See groff_char(7).

^L is now a legal input character.

Groff
-----

The Xps pseudo-device has disappeared.  Instead there is a new -X
option that tells groff to use gxditview instead of the usual
postprocessor. (So instead of -TXps, use -XTps or just -X if your
default device is ps.)

The postprocessor to be used for a particular device is now specified
by a `postpro' command in the DESC file rather than being compiled
into groff.  Similarly the command to be used for printing (with the
-l option) is now specified by a `print' command in the DESC file.

The groff command no longer specifies eqnchar as an input file for
eqn.  Instead eqn automatically loads a file `eqnrc'.  The groff
command no longer passes the -D option to eqn.  Instead eqnrc sets the
draw_lines parameter.

The groff command no longer tells troff to load a device-specific
macro file.  This is handled instead by the `troffrc' file, which is
always loaded by troff.

The shell script version of groff has been removed.

Troff
-----

The `rchar' request removes a character definition established with `char'.

Compatibility mode is disabled and the escape character is set to `\'
while a character definition is being processed.

The `\#' escape sequence is like `\"' except that the terminating
newline is ignored.

The `shc' request tells troff which character to insert (instead of
the default \(hy) when a word is hyphenated at a line break.

A font name of 0 (zero) in the DESC file will cause no font to be
mounted on the corresponding font position.  This is useful for
arranging that special fonts are mounted on positions on which users
are not likely explicitly to mount fonts.  All groff devices now avoid
initially mounting fonts on positions 5-9.

The `do' request allows a single request or macro to be interpreted
with compatibility mode disabled.

troff automatically loads a file `troffrc' before any other input file.
This can be prevented with the -R option.  This file is responsible
for loading the device-specific macros.

Pic
---

The -x option has been removed and a -n option has been added.  By
default, pic now assumes that the postprocessor supports groff
extensions.  The -n option tells pic to generate output that works
with ditroff drivers.  The -z option now applies only to TeX mode.

The -p option has been removed. Instead if the -n option is not
specified, pic generates output that uses \X'ps: ...' if the \n(0p
register is non-zero and tmac.ps sets this register to 1.

In places where you could 1st or 5th you can now say `i'th or `i+1'th
(the quotes are required).

Eqn
---

Eqn now automatically reads a file `eqnrc' from the macro directory.
This performs the same role that the eqnchar files used to.  This can
be prevented by the -R option.

Setting the draw_lines parameter to a non-zero value causes lines to
be drawn using \D rather than \l.  The -D option is now obsolete.

`uparrow', `downarrow' and `updownarrow' can be used with `left' and
`right'.

The amount of extra space added before and after lines containing
equations can be controlled using the `body_height' and `body_depth'
parameters.

Grops
-----

Font description files have been regenerated from newer AFM files.
You can get access to the additional characters present in the text
fonts in newer PostScript printers by using -mpsnew.

The default value of the -b option is specified by a `broken' command
in the DESC file.

With the -g option, grops will generate PostScript code that guesses
the page height.  This allows documents to be printed on both letter
(8.5x11) and A4 paper without change.

Grodvi
------

ISO Latin-1 characters are available with -Tdvi.  Format groff_char(7)
with groff -Tdvi for more information.

Grotty
------

The -mtty-char macros contain additional character definitions for
use with grotty.

Macros
------

In previous releases the groff -me macros treated the $r and $R number
registers in a way that was incompatible with the BSD -me macros.  The
reason for this was that the approach used by the BSD -me macros does
not work with low resolution devices such as -TX75 and -TX100.
However, this caused problems with existing -me documents.  In this
release, the vertical spacing is controlled by the $v and $V registers
which have the same meaning as $r and $R in earlier groff releases.
In addition, if the $r or $R register is set to a value that would be
correct for for the BSD -me macros and a low resolution device is not
being used, then an appropriate value for the $v or $V register will
be derived from the $r or $R register.

The groff -me macros work with -C and (I think) with Unix troff.

For backward compatibility with BSD -me, the \*{ and \*} strings are
also available as \*[ and \*].  Of course, \*[ will only be usable
with -C.

The \*T string has been deleted.  Use \*(Tm instead.

Xditview
--------

The `n', Space and Return keys are bound to the Next Page action.  The
`p', BackSpace and Delete keys are bound to the Previous Page action.
The `q' key is bound to the Quit action.

The `r' key is bound to a rerasterize action that reruns groff, and
redisplays the current page.

VERSION 1.05
============

Pic
---

There is a alternative assignment operator `:=' which interacts
differently with blocks.

There is a new command `command', which allows the values of variables
to be passed through to troff or TeX.

The `print' command now accepts multiple arguments.

String comparison expressions (using `==' or `!=') are allowed in more
contexts.

Grotty
------

Horizontal and vertical lines drawn with \D'l ...' will be rendered
using -, | and + characters.  This is intended to give reasonable
results with boxed tables.  It won't work well with pic.

Macros
------

The -mdoc macros have been upgraded to the version in the second
Berkeley networking release.  This version is not completely
compatible with earlier versions; the old version is still available
as -mdoc.old.  The grog script has been enhanced so that it can
usually determine whether a document requires the old or new versions.

With -TX75, -TX100 and -TXps, the PSPIC macro will produce a box
around where the picture would appear with -Tps.

VERSION 1.04
============

An implementation of the -mm macros is included.

The directory in which temporary files are created can be controlled
by setting the GROFF_TMPDIR or TMPDIR environment variables.

Pic
---

Some MS-DOS support (see pic/make-dos-dist).

Grops
-----

There are two new \X commands (\X'ps: invis' and \X'ps: endinvis')
which make it possible to have substitute characters that are
displayed when previewing with -TXps but ignored when printing with
grops.

Xditview
--------

Support for scalable fonts.

VERSION 1.03
============

No changes other than bug fixes.

VERSION 1.02
============

There is an implementation of refer and associated programs.  groff -R
preprocesses with grefer; no mechanism is provided for passing
arguments to grefer because most grefer options have equivalent
commands which can be included in the file.  grog also supports refer.

There is an alternative perl implementation of the grog script.

The code field in lines in the charset section of font description
files is now allowed to contain an arbitrary integer (previously it
was required to lie between 0 and 255).  Currently grops and grodvi
use only the low order 8 bits of the value.  Grodvi will use the
complete value; however, this is unlikely to be useful with
traditional TeX tools (.tfm files only allow 8 bit character codes.)

Left and right double quotes can be obtained with \(lq and \(rq
respectively.

There is a new program called pfbtops which translates PostScript
fonts in pfb format to ASCII.

A slightly modified version of the Berkeley tmac.doc is included.

Troff
-----

In long escape names the closing ] is now required to be at the same
input level as the opening [.

The \A'S' escape sequence returns 1 or 0 according as S is or is not
suitable for use as a name.

\~ produces an unbreakable space that can be stretched when the line
is adjusted.

The `mso' request is like the `so' request except that it searches for
the file in the same directories in which tmac.X is searched for when
the -mX option is given.

The escape sequence `\R' is similar to the `nr' request.

Eqn
---

A new `special' primitive allows you to add new types of unary
constructs by writing a troff macro.

Pic
---

The implementation no longer uses gperf.

Grops
-----

The compile-time -DBROKEN_SPOOLER option has been replaced by a
BROKEN_SPOOLER_FLAGS option.  This allows more precise control over
how grops should workaround broken spoolers and previewers.  There is
a new -b option that can change this at run-time.

Grops now generates PostScript that complies with version 3.0 of the
Document Structuring Convention.

The resource management component of grops (the part that deals with
imported documents and downloadable fonts) has been rewritten and now
supports version 3.0 of the Document Structuring Conventions.  The
%%DocumentFonts comment is no longer supported; you must use the
%%Document{Needed,Supplied}{Fonts,Resources} comments instead
(or as well.)

tmac.psatk contains some macros that support the mechanism used by the
Andrew Toolkit for including PostScript graphics in troff documents.

Xditview
--------

Parts of xditview have been rewritten so that it can be used with the
output of gtroff -Tps.  groff -TXps will run gtroff -Tps with
gxditview.

There is a new menu entry `Print' which brings up a dialog box for
specifying a command with which the file being previewed should be
printed.

Xditview now uses imake.

VERSION 1.01
============

The groff command now understands the gtroff `-a' and `-i' options.

With the `m' and `n' scale indicators, the scale factor is rounded
horizontally before being applied.  This makes (almost) no difference
for devices with `hor' equal to 1, but it makes groff with -Tascii or
-Tlatin1 behave more like nroff in its treatment of these scale
indicators.  Accordingly tmac.tty now calls the `nroff' request so
that the `n' condition will be true.

The device-specific macros (tmac.ps, tmac.dvi, tmac.tty and tmac.X)
have been made to work at least somewhat with -C.  In particular the
special characters defined by these macros now work with -C.

groff -Tdvi -p will now pass pic the -x flag; this will enable filling
of arrowheads and boxes, provided that your dvi driver supports the
latest version of the tpic specials.

Eqn
---

There is a new `-N' option that tells eqn not to allow newlines in
delimiters.  This allows eqn to recover better from missing closing
delimiters.  The groff command will pass on a `-N' option to eqn.

Grops
-----

You can now use psfig with grops.  See the file ps/psfig.diff.  I do
not recommend using psfig for new documents.

The command \X'ps: file F' is similar to \X'ps: exec ...' except that
the PostScript code is read from the file F instead of being contained
within the \X command.  This was added to support psfig.

Grodvi
------

There are font files HB and HI corresponding to cmsssbx10 and cmssi10.

Macros
------

The groff -me macros now work with the -C option.  As a result, they
may also work with Unix nroff/troff.

In -me, the $r and $R number registers now contain the line spacing as
a percentage of the pointsize expressed in units (normally about 120).
The previous definition was useless with low resolution devices such
as X75 and X100.

VERSION 1.00
============

A -ms-like macro-package is now included.

The name for the Icelandic lowercase eth character has been changed
from \(-d to \(Sd.

Troff
-----

There is a new request `nroff', which makes the `n' built-in condition
true and the `t' built-in condition false; also a new request `troff'
which undoes the effect of the `nroff' request.  This is intended only
for backward compatibility: it is usually better to test \n(.H or
\n(.V or to use the `c' built-in condition.

The \R escape sequence has been deleted.  Use \E instead.

There are `break' and `continue' requests for use with the `while'
request.

There is a request `hym' that can ensure that when the current
adjustment mode is not `b' a line will not be hyphenated if it is no
more than a given amount short, and a request `hys' that can ensure
that when the current adjustment mode is `b' a line will not be
hyphenated if it can be justified by adding no more than a given
amount of extra space to each word space.

There is a request `rj' similar to `ce' that right justifies lines.

A warning of type `space' will be given when a call is made to an
undefined request or macro with a name longer than two characters, and
the first two characters of the name make a name that is defined.
This is intended to find places where a space has been omitted been a
request or macro and its argument.  This type of warning is enabled by
default.

Pic
---

A comma is permitted between the arguments to the `reset' command.

For use with TeX, there is a new `-c' option that makes gpic treat
lines beginning with `.' in a way that is more compatible with tpic
(but ugly).

Eqn
---

It is no longer necessary to add `space 0' at the beginning of
complicated equations inside pictures.

`prime' is now treated as an ordinary character, as in Unix eqn.  The
previous behaviour of `prime' as an operator can now be obtained using
`opprime'.

Xditview
--------

There are two new devices X75-12 and X100-12 which are the same as X75
and X100 except that they are optimized for documents that use mostly
12 point text.

VERSION 0.6
===========

The installation process has been refined to make it easy for you to
share groff with someone who has the same type of machine as you but
does not have a C++ compiler.  See the end of the INSTALL file for
details.

There is a man page for the tfmtodit program which explains how to use
your own fonts with groff -Tdvi.

There is a man page for afmtodit which explains how to use your own
PostScript fonts with groff -Tps.

The \N escape sequence is now fully supported.  It can now be used to
access any character in a font by its output code, even if it doesn't
have a groff name.  This is made possible by a convention in the font
files that a character name of `---' refers to an unnamed character.
The drivers now all support the `N' command required for this.  The font
description files have been updated to include unnamed characters.

The `x' command in font description files has been removed: instead
any unknown commands are automatically made available to the drivers.
If you constructed your own font files with an earlier version of
tfmtodit or afmtodit, you must construct them again using the current
version.

Characters between 0200 and 0237 octal are no longer legal input
characters.  Note that these are not used in ISO 8859.

A command called `grog' has been added, similar to the `doctype'
command described in Kernighan and Pike.

Groff
-----

The groff command has some new options: -V prints the pipeline
instead of executing it; -P passes an argument to the postprocessor,
-L passes an argument to the spooler.

There is a C++ implementation of the groff command.  This handles some
things slightly better than the shell script.  In particular, it can
correctly handle arguments containing characters that have a special
meaning to the shell; it can give an error message when child
processes other than the last in the pipeline terminate abnormally;
its exit status can take account of the exit statuses of all its child
processes; it is a little more efficient; when geqn is used, it
searches for the eqnchar file in the same way that font metric files
are searched for, rather than expecting to find it in one particular
directory.

Gtroff
------

There is font translation feature: For example, you can tell gtroff to
use font `HR' whenever font `H' is requested with the line
  .ftr H HR
This would be useful for a document that uses `H' to refer to
Helvetica.

There are some new number registers: `.kern' contains the current kern
mode, `.lg' the current ligature mode, `.x' the major version number,
`.y' the minor version number, `.ce' the number of lines to be
centered in the current environment, `.trunc' the amount of vertical
space truncated by the most recently sprung vertical position trap,
`.ne' the amount of vertical space needed in the last `ne' request
that caused a vertical position trap to be sprung.

The `cf' request now behaves sensibly in a diversion.  If used in a
diversion, it will now arrange for the file to be copied to the output
when the diversion is reread.

There is a new request `trf' (transparent file) similar to `cf', but
more like `\!'.

There is a new escape sequence `\Y[xxx]', roughly equivalent to
`\X'\*[xxx]'', except that the contents of string or macro xxx are not
interpreted, and xxx may contain newlines.  This requires an output
format extension; the drivers have been modified to understand this.
Grops has also been modified to cope with newlines in the arguments to
\X commands; grops has a new \X command mdef, which is like def except
that it has a first argument giving the number of definitions.

There is a new warning category `escape' which warns about unknown
escape sequences.

The `fp' request now takes an optional third argument giving the external
name of the font.

The `\_' character is now automatically translated to `\(ul' as in troff.

The environment variable `GROFF_HYPHEN' gives the name of the file
containing the hyphenation patterns.

There is a `\C'xxx'' escape sequence equivalent to `\[xxx]'.

Characters ", ', ), ], *, \(dg are now initially transparent for the purposes
of end of sentence recognition.

There is an anti-recursion feature in the `char' request, so you can
say `.char \(bu \s+2\(bu\s-2'.

The limit on the number of font positions has been removed.
Accordingly `\n[.fp]' never returns 0.

The restriction on the number of numbered environments has been removed.

There is a new escape sequence `\E' that makes it possible to
guarantee that an escape sequence won't get interpreted in copy-mode.
The `\R' escape sequence is accordingly now deprecated.

Gpic
----

Arguments of the form `X anything X' (in the `copy thru', `sh', `for',
`if' and `define' constructs) can now be of the form `{ anything }'.

If the `linethick' variable is negative (as it now is initially),
lines will be drawn with a thickness proportional to the current point
size.

The `rand' function now takes no arguments and returns a number between
0 and 1.  The old syntax is still supported.

`^' can be used in expressions to indicate exponentiation.

In the `for' construct the argument to the by clause can be prefixed
by `*' to indicate that the increment is multiplicative.

A bare expression may be used as an attribute.  If the current
direction is `dir', then an attribute `expr' is equivalent to
`dir expr'

There is a `sprintf' construct that allows numbers to be formatted and used
wherever a quoted string can be used.

The height of a text object without an explicit height attribute is
the number of text strings associated with the object times the value
of the `textht' variable.

The maximum height and width of a picture is controlled by the
`maxpswid' and `maxpsht' variables.

Gtbl
----

Gtbl can now handle gracefully the situation where the `ce' request
has been applied to a table.

Geqn
----

The `ifdef' primitive has been generalized.

A tilde accent can be put underneath a box using `utilde'.  This
defined using a general `uaccent' primitive.

Grops
-----

There is a new PostScript font downloading scheme which handles font
downloading for imported illustrations.  Previously, the name of the
file containing the font was given in the `x download' line in the
groff font metric file.  Now, there is a `download' file which says
for each PostScript font name which file contains that font.  Grops
can also now handle inter-font dependencies, where one downloadable
font depends on some other (possibly downloadable) font.

The `T' font has been removed.  The characters it used to provide are
now provided by `char' definitions in tmac.ps. TSymbol.ps has also
been removed, and the tweaks it provided are now provided by `char'
definitions.
