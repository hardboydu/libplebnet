#	$Id$

To re-create this directory from outside the US, take the Makefile
(provided), get the two source files from the original eBones distribution,
do a `perl -spi.bak -e 's/\$(Header[^\$])\$/$1/g' *.{c,ct}', and then
edit the #includes in kadmin.c to make things compile.

Unfortunately, this program is not exportable.
