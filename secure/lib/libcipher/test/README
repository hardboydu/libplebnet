This directory contains test programs to certify DES operation and to
time the crypt() call (of curiosity value).

Simply type `make test` to run the tests.

The normal `make all` and `make install` that get done during library building
and installation will build these programs BUT NOT INSTALL THEM.  After all,
they're only for testing...
