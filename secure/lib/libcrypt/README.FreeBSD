$FreeBSD$

This is FreeSec package for NetBSD,  unchanged for
FreeBSD, except for the Makefile.

FreeSec was written by David Burren <davidb@werj.com.au>

A few bugs in the original FreeSec release have been fixed.

In order to make libcrypt binaries exportable from the USA,
only the symbol _crypt() (later to be changed to ___crypt())
is exported from libcrypt.

This source code was developed outside the USA, and can be
obtained outside the USA.
