.Sh NAME
.Nm scrshot
.Nd capture the contents of a syscons terminal
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility uses the
.Xr syscons 4
.Li CONS_SCRSHOT
ioctl to capture the current contents of the video buffer corresponding to the
terminal device given as the first argument.
.Nm
writes version and additional information to the standard output, followed by
the contents of the terminal device.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
PC video memory is typically arranged in two byte tuples, one per character
position.  In each tuple, the first byte will be the character code, and the
second byte is the character's colour attribute.
.Pp
The colour attribute byte is further broken down in to the low nybble, which
specifies which of 16 different foreground colours is active, and the high
nybble, which specifies which of 16 different background colours is active.

.Pp
It can be seen that the last 8 colours are brighter versions of the first 8.
.Pp
For example, the two bytes
.Bd -literal -offset indent
65 158
.Ed
.Pp
specify an uppercase A (character code 65), in yellow (low nybble 15) on a
light blue background (high nybble 9).
.Pp
The
.Nm
output contains a small header which includes additional information which may
be useful to utilities processing the output.
.Pp
The first 10 bytes are always arranged as follows:
.Bl -column "Byte range " "Contents " -offset -indent
.It Sy Byte Range Ta Sy Contents
.It 1 thru 8 Ta Literal text Dq SCRSHOT_
.It 9 Ta File format version number
.It 10 Ta Remaining number of bytes in the header
.El
.Pp
Subsequent bytes depend on the version number.
.Bl -column "Version " "4 and up" -offset indent
.It Sy Version Ta Sy Byte Ta Sy Meaning
.It 1 Ta 11 Ta Terminal width, in characters
.It Ta 12 Ta Terminal depth, in characters
.It Ta 13 and up Ta The snapshot data
.El
.Pp
So a dump of an 80x25 screen would start (in hex)
.Bd -literal -offset indent
53 43 52 53 48 4f 54 5f 01 02 50 19

          |              |  `------ 2 remaining bytes of header data

          `------------------------ Literal "SCRSHOT_"
.Ed
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Ic scrshot /dev/ttyv0 > shot.scr
.Ed
.Pp
will capture the contents of the first virtual terminal, and redirect the
output to the
.Li shot.scr
file.
