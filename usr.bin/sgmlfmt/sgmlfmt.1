.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command reads SGML files tagged according to the linuxdoc DTD,
validates them using the
.Xr sgmls 1
parser and then converts them to the specified output format.
The input file must include the following document type
declaration before any uncommented text:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
<!DOCTYPE linuxdoc PUBLIC "-//FreeBSD//DTD linuxdoc//EN">
.Ed
.Pp
The 
.Fl Ar format
options for output include the following:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl html
Generates a set of linked HTML files suitable for use with an
HTML browser.  A top level file,
.Pa file.html ,
contains the title, author, date, abstract and brief table of
contents for the document.  A file
.Pa file_toc.html
contains a complete table of contents.  A series of files named
.Pa file-1.html ,
.Pa file-2.html ...
.Pa file-n.html
contain the actual text of the document.
.It Fl latex
Generates a single output file with the extension
.Pa .tex
suitable for processing with LaTeX.  Note that the LaTeX style
file
.Pa /usr/share/sgml/FreeBSD/lib/linuxdoc.sty
must be accessible to LaTeX for correct processing.
.It Fl ascii
Generates a single output file with the extension 
.Pa .txt
suitable for viewing on an ASCII terminal. 
.It Fl nroff
Generates a single output file with the extension
.Pa .nroff
suitable processing with
.Xr nroff 1
or
.Xr groff 1 .
This is actually an intermediate conversion used by the
.Fl ascii
format option.
.El
.Pp
If the input file name ends with
.Pa .sgml ,
the extension may be omitted on the command line.
In all cases, the output files are created in the current working
directory.

.Sh BUGS
A line in the SGML source file beginning with a period (.) will
confuse
.Xr groff 1
which is used to generate ASCII output.  In general, the ASCII
output leaves much to be desired.
.Pp
The divison of the sources file into separate HTML files is
currently fixed.
