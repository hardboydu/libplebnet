.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm fetch
allows a user to transfer files from a remote network site using
either the
.Em ftp
or the
.Em http
protocol. In the first form of the command, the
.Ar URL
may be of the form 
.Em http://site.domain/path/to/the/file
or
.Em ftp://site.domain/path/to/the/file. 
For compatibility with 
.Xr tftp 1
the form 
.Em site.domain:/path/to/the/file
is also accepted.
To denote a local filename to be copied or linked to (see
.Fl l
flag), the
.Em file:/path/to/the/file
URL form is used.

The second form of the command can be used to get a file using the
.Em ftp
protocol, specifying the file name and the remote host with the 
.Fl h
and the 
.Fl f
flags.

The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl -compact
.It Fl M
.It Fl m
Mirror mode: Set the modification time of the file so that it is
identical to the modification time of the file at the remote host.
If the file already exists on the local host and is identical (as
gauged by size and modification time), no transfer is done.

Don't preserve the modtime of the transfered file, use the current time.

Use passive mode if you are behind a firewall.
