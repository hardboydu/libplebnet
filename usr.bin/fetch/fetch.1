.Sh NAME
.Nm fetch
.Nd retrieve a file by Uniform Resource Locator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 146AFHMPRadlmnpqrsv
.Op Fl B Ar bytes
.Op Fl S Ar bytes
.Op Fl T Ar seconds
.Op Fl o Ar file
.Op Fl w Ar seconds
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl c Ar dir
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Ar URL ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Fetch
provides a command-line interface to the
.Xr fetch 3
library.
Its purpose is to retrieve the file(s) pointed to by the URL(s) on the
command line.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl \&1
Stop and return exit code 0 at the first successfully retrieved file.
.It Fl 4
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl A
Do not automatically follow ``temporary'' (302) redirects.
Some broken Web sites will return a redirect instead of a not-found
error when the requested object does not exist.
.It Fl a
Automatically retry the transfer upon soft failures.
.It Fl B Ar bytes
Specify the read buffer size in bytes.
The default is 4096 bytes.
Attempts to set a buffer size lower than this will be silently
ignored.
The number of reads actually performed is reported at verbosity level
two or higher (see the
.Fl v
flag).
.It Fl c Ar dir
The file to retrieve is in directory
.Ar dir
on the remote host.
This option is deprecated and is provided for backward compatibility
only.
.It Fl d
Use a direct connection even if a proxy is configured.
.It Fl F
In combination with the
.Fl r
flag, forces a restart even if the local and remote files have
different modification times.
.It Fl f Ar file
The file to retrieve is named
.Ar file
on the remote host.
This option is deprecated and is provided for backward compatibility
only.
.It Fl H
When using passive FTP, allocate a high port for the data connection.
See
.Xr ip 4
for details on how to specify which port range this corresponds to.
.It Fl h Ar host
The file to retrieve is located on the host
.Ar host .
This option is deprecated and is provided for backward compatibility
only.
.It Fl l
If the target is a file-scheme URL, make a symbolic link to the target
rather than trying to copy it.
.It Fl M
.It Fl m
Mirror mode: if the file already exists locally and has the same size
and modification time as the remote file, it will not be fetched.
Note that the
.Fl m
and
.Fl r
flags are mutually exclusive.
.It Fl n
Don't preserve the modification time of the transferred file.
.It Fl o Ar file
Set the output file name to 
.Ar file .
By default, a ``pathname'' is extracted from the specified URI, and
its basename is used as the name of the output file.
A
.Ar file
argument of
.Sq Li \&-
indicates that results are to be directed to the standard output.
.It Fl P
.It Fl p
Use passive FTP.
This is useful if you are behind a firewall which blocks incoming
connections.
Try this flag if
.Nm
seems to hang when retrieving FTP URLs.
.It Fl q
Quiet mode.
.It Fl R
The output files are precious, and should not be deleted under any
circumstances, even if the transfer failed or was incomplete.
.It Fl r
Restart a previously interrupted transfer.
Note that the
.Fl m
and
.Fl r
flags are mutually exclusive.
.It Fl S Ar bytes
Require the file size reported by the server to match the specified
value.
If it does not, a message is printed and the file is not fetched.
If the server does not support reporting file sizes, this option is
ignored and the file is fetched unconditionally.
.It Fl s
Print the size in bytes of each requested file, without fetching it.
.It Fl T Ar seconds
Set timeout value to
.Ar seconds .
Overrides the environment variables
.Ev FTP_TIMEOUT
for FTP transfers or
.Ev HTTP_TIMEOUT 
for HTTP transfers if set.
.It Fl v
Increase verbosity level.
.It Fl w Ar seconds
When the
.Fl a
flag is specified, wait this many seconds between successive retries.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
command returns zero on success, or one on failure.
If multiple URLs are listed on the command line,
.Nm
will attempt to retrieve them each of them in turn, and return zero
only if they were all successfully retrieved.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width FTP_PASSIVE_MODE -offset indent
.It Ev FTP_TIMEOUT
maximum time, in seconds, to wait before aborting an 
.Tn FTP
connection.
.It Ev HTTP_TIMEOUT
maximum time, in seconds, to wait before aborting an
.Tn HTTP
connection.
.El
.Pp
All environment variables mentioned in the documentation for the
.Xr fetch 3
library are supported.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fetch 3
.Sh HISTORY
The 
.Nm
command appeared in
.Fx 2.1.5 .
This implementation first appeared in
.Fx 4.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The original implementation of
.Nm
was done by
.An Jean-Marc Zucconi .
It was extensively re-worked for
.Fx 2.2
by
.An Garrett Wollman ,
and later completely rewritten to use the
.Xr fetch 3
library by
.An Dag-Erling Sm\(/orgrav .
.Sh NOTES
The
.Fl b
and
.Fl t
options are no longer supported and will generate warnings.
They were workarounds for bugs in other OSes which this implementation
does not trigger.
.Pp
One cannot both use the
.Fl h ,
.Fl c
and
.Fl f
options and specify URLs on the command line.
