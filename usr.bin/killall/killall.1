.Dt KILLALL 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm killall
.Nd kill processes by name
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm killall
.Op Fl d \&| Ns Fl v
.Op Fl h \&| Ns Fl \&?
.Op Fl help
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl m
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl SIGNAL
.Ar procname ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Killall
kills processes selected by name, as opposed to the selection by pid
as done by
.Xr kill 1 .
By default, it will send a
.Dv TERM
signal to all processes with an effective UID identical to the
caller of
.Nm
that match the name
.Ar procname .
The super-user is allowed to kill any process.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 10n -offset indent
.It Fl d \&| Ns Fl v
Be more verbose about what will be done.  For a single
.Fl d
option, a list of the processes that will be sent the signal will be
printed, or a message indicating that no matching processes have been
found.  If the option
.Fl d
has been specified at least twice, the effective UID, PID, and name
of all processes found in
.Xr procfs 5
will be listed in addition.
.It Fl h \&| Ns Fl \&?
.It Fl help
Give a help on the command usage and exit.
.It Fl l
List the names of the available signals and exit, like in
.Xr kill 1 .
.It Fl m
Match the argument
.Ar procname
as a (case insensitive) regular expression against the names 
of processes found in
.Xr procfs 5 .
CAUTION!  This is dangerous, a single dot will match any process
running under the effective UID of the caller.  The regular expression
syntax in effect is that used by
.Xr perl 1 .
.It Fl s
Show only what would be done, but do net send any signal.
.It Fl SIGNAL
Send a different signal instead of the default
.Dv TERM .
The signal may be specified either as a name
.Pq with \&or without a leading Dv SIG ,
or numerically.
.El

.Sh ALL PROCESSES
Sending a signal to all processes with uid 
.Nm XYZ
is already supported by
.Xr kill 1 . 
So use 
.Xr kill 1
for this job (e.g. $ kill -TERM -1 or
as root $ echo kill -TERM -1 | su -m <user>)


.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
command will respond with a short usage message and exit with a status
of 2 in case of a command error.  A status of 1 will be returned if
either no matching process has been found or not all processes have
been signalled successfully.  Otherwise, a status of 0 will be
returned.
.Pp
Diagnostic messages will only be printed if requested by
.Fl d
options.

.Xr procfs 5 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Fx 2.1 .
It has been modeled after the
.Nm
command as available on other platforms.
