.Sh NAME
.Nm rfcomm_sppd
.Nd RFCOMM Serial Port Profile daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl a Ar BD_ADDR
.Op Fl b
.Op Fl c Ar channel
.Op Fl t Ar tty
.Op Fl h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a Serial Port Profile daemon. It opens RFCOMM connection to the
specified server's BD_ADDR and channel. Once connection is established 
.Nm
provides access to the server's remote serial port via 
.Xr pty 4
interface.
.Pp
.Nm
opens both master and slave pseudo terminals. This is done to ensure that
RFCOMM connection stays open until
.Nm
is terminated. The data received from the master pseudo terminal are sent over 
the RFCOMM connection. The data received from the RFCOMM connection are written
into master pseudo terminal. The application in its turn opens slave pseudo 
terminal and operates on it just like it would operate over the standard serial
port.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a Ar BD_ADDR
This requied option specifies the remote BD_ADDR of the RFCOMM server. 
.It Fl b
Detach from the controlling terminal, i.e. run in background.
.It Fl c Ar channel
This required option specifies RFCOMM channel to connect to. This channel
must provide Serial Port service.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Slave pseudo tty name.
.It Fl h
Display usage message and exit.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It rfcomm_sppd -a 00:01:02:03:04:05 -c 1 -t /dev/ttyp1
.Pp
Will start
.Nm
and open RFCOMM connection to the server at
.Em 00:01:02:03:04:05 
and channel 
.Em 1 .
Once connection has been established
.Pa /dev/ttyp1
can be used to talk to the remote serial port on the server.
