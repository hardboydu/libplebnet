.Sh NAME
.Nm rfcomm_sppd
.Nd RFCOMM Serial Port Profile daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl bh
.Fl a Ar BD_ADDR
.Fl c Ar channel
.Fl t Ar tty
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a Serial Port Profile daemon.
It opens RFCOMM connection to the specified server's
.Ar BD_ADDR
and
.Ar channel .
Once connection is established, the
.Nm
utility provides access to the server's remote serial port via
.Xr pty 4
interface.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility opens both master and slave pseudo terminals.
This is done to ensure that RFCOMM connection stays open until
.Nm
is terminated.
The data received from the master pseudo terminal are sent over
the RFCOMM connection.
The data received from the RFCOMM connection are written
into master pseudo terminal.
The application in its turn opens the slave pseudo
terminal and operates on it just like it would operate over the standard serial
port.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a Ar BD_ADDR
This required option specifies the remote BD_ADDR of the RFCOMM server.
.It Fl b
Detach from the controlling terminal, i.e., run in background.
.It Fl c Ar channel
This required option specifies RFCOMM channel to connect to.
This channel must provide Serial Port service.
.It Fl h
Display usage message and exit.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Slave pseudo tty name.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl "rfcomm_sppd -a 00:01:02:03:04:05 -c 1 -t /dev/ttyp1"
.Pp
Will start the
.Nm
utility and open RFCOMM connection to the server at
.Li 00:01:02:03:04:05
and channel
.Li 1 .
Once the connection has been established,
.Pa /dev/ttyp1
can be used to talk to the remote serial port on the server.
