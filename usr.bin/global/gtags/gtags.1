makes GTAGS, GRTAGS files for global(1).
.Nm Gtags
trace subdirectories, read source files,
locate the functions and save the information into tag files.
C, yacc and assembler source files are supported.
You should execute this command at the root of the source tree.
.Pp
If your source directory is on a read only device like CDROM, specify
.Ar dbpath
of the directory on which make tags files.

.Sh BUG
GTAGS, GRTAGS are very large. In advance, check the space of your disk.

Assembler support is far from completeness.  It extracts only ENTRY()
and ALTENTRY() from source file. Probably valid only for FreeBSD and Linux
kernel source.
