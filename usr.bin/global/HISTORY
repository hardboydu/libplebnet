GLOBAL history
--------------

version 1.0	initial version [21-Apr-96]

version 1.1	only bugfix [2-May-96]

	[fixed bug]
	global	- makes corrupted path name by conversion error.
		- description of exit code in online manual is mistaken.
	btreeop	- cannot treat a long line over BUFSIZ. With the result
		that gtags fails.
	extended ctags - when using -r option, considers a reserved word
		to be a function name. With the result that GRTAGS becomes
		too large.

version 1.2	mainly unification of files [7-Jun-96]

	[changed]
	extended ctags
		- change to use bsearch(3) for searching reserved words.
		- change to consider '__P' as a reserved word.
		- unify the original patch (included in version1.0) and
		  the bugfix patch (included in version1.1).
	extended vi
		- unify the VI entended patch.

version 1.3	support of GTAGSLIBPATH [28-Jul-96]

	[changed]
	global  - search in not only a source tree but also library paths
		  specified by environment variable GTAGSLIBPATH.
	extended ctags
		- change print format a little when -x option

version 1.4	support of yacc source file [26-Oct-96]

	[changed]
	extended ctags
		- support of yacc source file.
		- this version of ctags is NOT COMPATIBLE with original one.
		  * search all part of a yacc file for C functions.
		    (original only 3rd part)
		  * no longer considers a yacc rule to be an object.

version 1.5	hypertext generator [12-Dec-96]

	[fixed bug]
	gtags	- doesn't skip 'y.tab.c'.(we should treat only *.y)
	extended vi
		- free stack memory. free(3) in FreeBSD 2.1.5R seems to
		  show a warning message when receive stack address.
		  So it spoils the screen.
	[added]
	htags	- new command (hypertext generator of C source file)
	gtags	- error check code added.

version 1.6	support of 1.76 nvi and reconstruction for other OS [21-Jan-97]

	[changed]
	htags	- cease using <BLOCKQUOTE> because lynx doesn't understand it.
	global,htags
		- replace 'sort -u' with 'sort | uniq' for compatibility reason.
	[fixed bug]
	global	- makes illegal path name when using GTAGSLIBPATH.
	gtags	- error message mistaken.
	[added]
	nvi-1.76.diff
		- patch for nvi 1.76 to make extended vi.
	gctags	- this is the same with extended ctags in older version.
		  now GLOBAL includes BSD ctags in it. so no longer has
		  patch file (ctags.diff).
		  (I brought original ctags from FreeBSD 2.1.5R)
	global	- -a option added.

version 1.7	make suitable for large project (mainly FreeBSD kernel) [17-Feb-97]

	[changed]
	htags	- htags no longer makes frame.html. Index.html offers frame
		  function too.
		- works MUCH faster than previous version.
	[fixed bug]
	htags	- string 'param' follows '&' means specific charactor in hypertext.
		  So, changed internal separator from '&' to '|'.
	[added]
	gtags	- -s option added. If specified, gtags extract ENTRY() and
		  ALTENTRY() from *.[sS] files.
	htags	- supports one level nested index. It's always valid for file
		  index when directories found, and valid for function index
		  only when -a option specified.
		- -v and -t option added.
	systags.sh
		- script to make all tags (GTAGS,GRTAGS,HTML) for kernel source.
		  (it is only for FreeBSD and Linux)

version 1.8	fix some bugs, add options and make more portable [5-Apr-97]

	[changed]
	gctags, btreeop, Makefile
		- modify for generic UNIX (Linux, Solaris)
		- modify to quiet compiler.

		Many thanks to
			A.E. Brouwer
			Oleg Checkulaev
			Emile Heyns

	gctags	- modify to treat '\r' at the end of line.
	htags	- changed internal separator from '|' to ' '.
		  because some OS cannot treat '|' in a path.
	[fixed bug]
	htags	- regard a part of path in #include as a reserved word.
		- generate illegal links when same tags exist in a line.
		- insufficient comment detection.
	gctags	- regard function name as a definition in extern statement.
		- skip macro(no argment) body when -r specified.
	gctags, htags
		- regard 'entry' as a reserved word.
	[added]
	global	- -c (complete) option added.
	htags	- -d tagdir option added.
		- -w option added.

version 1.81	make global to understand 'obj' directory and bug fix. [14-Apr-97]

	[fixed bug]
	extended vi
		- doesn't hand '\' in a pattern to global.
