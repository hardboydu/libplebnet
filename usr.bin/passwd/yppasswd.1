.Sh DESCRIPTION
When distributing your users' passwords over NIS (a.k.a. YP), the standard
.Nm passwd ,
.Nm chpass ,
.Nm chfn , and
.Nm chsh
utilities cannot be
used anymore to let a user change her password, because they only modify
the password file on the local host.  They are usually replaced by their
YP counterparts, \fByppasswd\fP, \fBypchpass\fP, \fBypchfn\fP and \fBypchsh\fP.
.Pp
These commands are in fact the very same program, linked to different names.
Using the command line switches, you can choose whether to update your
password, your login shell (\fB-s\fP), or your GECOS field
information (\fB-f\fP), or a combination of them. \fBchfn\fP and
\fByppasswd\fP \fB-f\fP are equivalent, as are \fBchsh\fP and
\fByppasswd\fP \fB-s\fP.
.Pp
When invoked without the \fIuser\fP argument, the account information for
the invoking user will be updated, otherwise that of \fIuser\fP will be
updated.  This option is only available to the superuser.
.Pp
All tools will first prompt the user for the current NIS password needed
for authentication with the \fByppasswdd\fP daemon. Subsequently, the
program prompts for the updated information:
.\"
.\"
.Pp "\fByppasswd\fP
Change the user's NIS password. The user is prompted for the new password.
While typing the password, echoing is turned off, so the password does not
appear on the screen. An empty password is rejected, as are passwords shorter
than six characters. The user will then be requested to retype the
password to make sure it wasn't misspelled the first time.
.\"
.\"
.Pp "\fBypchsh\fP or \fB-s\fP
Change the user's login shell. The user is prompted for a new shell,
offering the old one as default:
.Pp
.in +2n
.ft B
.nf
Login shell [/bin/bash]: _
.fi
.ft
.in
.Pp
To accept the default, simply press return. To clear the shell field in
your \fBpasswd\fP file entry (so that the system's default shell is selected),
enter the string \fInone\fP.
.\"
.\"
.Pp "\fBypchfn\fP or \fB-f\fP
Change the user's full name and related information. Traditionally, some
applications expect the GECOS field (field 4) of the \fBpasswd\fP file to
contain the user's real name (as opposed to the login name) plus some
additional information like the office phone number. This information is
displayed by \fBfinger(1)\fP and probably some other tools, too.
.Pp
When setting the full name, \fBypchfn\fP displays the following prompts,
with the defaults in brackets:
.Pp
.in +2n
.ft B
.nf
Name [Joe Doe]: 
Location [2nd floor, bldg 34]:
Office Phone [12345]:
Home Phone []:
.fi
.ft
.in
.Pp
To accept a default, simply press return. To clear a field, enter the string
\fInone\fP.
.Sh LICENSE
This program is a heavily beefed-up version of Theo de Raadt's \fByppasswd\fP
client, which is covered by the BSD license.  Therefore, the BSD license
applies to this program as well.
