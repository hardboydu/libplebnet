Follow the process specified by 
.Ar pid
instead of a new command.
.It Fl o
Print the output to the specified file instead of standard error.
.It Ar command
Execute
.Ar command
and trace the system calls of it.
(The
.Fl p
and

options are mutually exclusive.)
.Sh EXAMPLES
# Follow the system calls used in echoing "hello"
.Dl $ truss /bin/echo hello
# Do the same, but put the output into a file
.Dl $ truss -o /tmp/truss.out /bin/echo hello
# Follow an already-running process
.Dl $ truss -p 1
