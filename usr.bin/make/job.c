 *
 * Interface:
 *	Job_Make  	    	Start the creation of the given target.
 *
 *	Job_CatchChildren   	Check for and handle the termination of any
 *	    	  	    	children. This must be called reasonably
 *	    	  	    	frequently to keep the whole make going at
 *	    	  	    	a decent clip, since job table entries aren't
 *	    	  	    	removed until their process is caught this way.
 *	    	  	    	Its single argument is TRUE if the function
 *	    	  	    	should block waiting for a child to terminate.
 *
 *	Job_CatchOutput	    	Print any output our children have produced.
 *	    	  	    	Should also be called fairly frequently to
 *	    	  	    	keep the user informed of what's going on.
 *	    	  	    	If no output is waiting, it will block for
 *	    	  	    	a time given by the SEL_* constants, below,
 *	    	  	    	or until output is ready.
 *
 *	Job_Init  	    	Called to intialize this module. in addition,
 *	    	  	    	any commands attached to the .BEGIN target
 *	    	  	    	are executed before this function returns.
 *	    	  	    	Hence, the makefile must have been parsed
 *	    	  	    	before this function is called.
 *
 *	Job_Full  	    	Return TRUE if the job table is filled.
 *
 *	Job_Empty 	    	Return TRUE if the job table is completely
 *	    	  	    	empty.
 *
 *	Job_ParseShell	    	Given the line following a .SHELL target, parse
 *	    	  	    	the line as a shell specification. Returns
 *	    	  	    	FAILURE if the spec was incorrect.
 *
 *	Job_Finish	  	    	Perform any final processing which needs doing.
 *	    	  	    	This includes the execution of any commands
 *	    	  	    	which have been/were attached to the .END
 *	    	  	    	target. It should only be called when the
 *	    	  	    	job table is empty.
 *
 *	Job_AbortAll	    	Abort all currently running jobs. It doesn't
 *	    	  	    	handle output or do anything for the jobs,
 *	    	  	    	just kills them. It should only be called in
 *	    	  	    	an emergency, as it were.
 *
 *	Job_CheckCommands   	Verify that the commands for a target are
 *	    	  	    	ok. Provide them if necessary and possible.
 *
 *	Job_Touch 	    	Update a target without really updating it.
 *
 *	Job_Wait  	    	Wait for all currently-running jobs to finish.
