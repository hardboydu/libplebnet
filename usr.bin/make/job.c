 * job.c --
 *	handle the creation etc. of our child processes.
 *
 * Interface:
 *	Job_Make	Start the creation of the given target.
 *
 *	Job_CatchChildren
 *			Check for and handle the termination of any children.
 *			This must be called reasonably frequently to keep the
 *			whole make going at a decent clip, since job table
 *			entries aren't removed until their process is caught
 *			this way. Its single argument is TRUE if the function
 *			should block waiting for a child to terminate.
 *
 *	Job_CatchOutput	Print any output our children have produced. Should
 *			also be called fairly frequently to keep the user
 *			informed of what's going on. If no output is waiting,
 *			it will block for a time given by the SEL_* constants,
 *			below, or until output is ready.
 *
 *	Job_Init	Called to intialize this module. in addition, any
 *			commands attached to the .BEGIN target are executed
 *			before this function returns. Hence, the makefile must
 *			have been parsed before this function is called.
 *
 *	Job_Full	Return TRUE if the job table is filled.
 *
 *	Job_Empty	Return TRUE if the job table is completely empty.
 *
 *	Job_ParseShell	Given the line following a .SHELL target, parse the
 *			line as a shell specification. Returns FAILURE if the
 *			spec was incorrect.
 *
 *	Job_Finish	Perform any final processing which needs doing. This
 *			includes the execution of any commands which have
 *			been/were attached to the .END target. It should only
 *			be called when the job table is empty.
 *
 *	Job_AbortAll	Abort all currently running jobs. It doesn't handle
 *			output or do anything for the jobs, just kills them.
 *			It should only be called in an emergency, as it were.
 *
 *	Job_CheckCommands
 *			Verify that the commands for a target are ok. Provide
 *			them if necessary and possible.
 *
 *	Job_Touch	Update a target without really updating it.
 *
 *	Job_Wait	Wait for all currently-running jobs to finish.

 *	    name  	    Name of shell.
 *	    path  	    Location of shell. Overrides "name" if given
 *	    quiet 	    Command to turn off echoing.
