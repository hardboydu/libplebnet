.Sh NAME
.Nm uac
.Nd Unaligned Access Message Control
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm uac
.Op Fl fprs
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sets the per-process handling of "Unaligned Access" events.  Unlike many
other CPU's the DEC Alpha processor cannot access unaligned data.  To work
around this, the Alpha has the ability to fix the UA fault rather than send
the faulting process a SIGBUS signal.  However, doing so does slow down the
execution of the faulting process.
At boot up, the DEC Alpha CPU defaults to printing 
.Bl -diag
.It pid nnn (<progname>): unaligned access: va=0xADDR pc=0xADDR ra=0xADDR op=ldl
.El
.Pp
when a UA happens along with fixing it so
the faulting instruction can continue.
UA handling settings are inherited by child process.
Issued with out any options,
.Mn
displays the current UA handling for the parent process.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl f
Unaligned access errors are not fixed for the parent and its future descendants.
.It Fl p
Unaligned access errors are not printed for the parent and its future
descendants.
.It Fl r
Resets the unaligned access error settings back to their bootup defaults.
.It Fl s
Unaligned access errors result in a SIGBUS being delivered to the parent and
its future descendants.  This aid in pin pointing the faulting access so it
debugged.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success, and 1 if the command
fails for any reason.
.El
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Nm
command syntax is incompatible with the DEC OSF/1 syntax.
.Sh SEE ALSO
