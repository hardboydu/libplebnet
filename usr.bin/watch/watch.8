.Sh NAME
watch - tty snoop watching utility. 

.Sh SYNOPSIS

 watch [-ciot] [<tty name>]

.Sh DESCRIPTION
 watch utility allows user to see all data coming to the tty,almost
 the same way as user on this tty.
 Only root can run watch.

The following options are available:

-c   Reconnect on close. When tty on which watching was made closed,
     utility will automatically reattach itself to the same tty.
     By default utility will ask user to enter new tty name if running
     in interactive mode or exit while non-interactive.

-i   Force interactive mode.Interactive mode is a default if utility
     started from tty. If output redirected to file, you can still force
     it into interactive mode by this option.

-o   Reconnect on overflow. The behaviour of utility on overflow is same
     as for tty close. For more info see snp(4).

-t   Timestamp.Print date and time each time, tty watching started.

 The <tty name> is one of following types:
  ttyp?,ttyq?,ttyr? - pseudo tty devices.
  ttyv? - virtual ttys (syscons).
  tty0?,ttyd? - serial lines.
 Each name can be preceeded by "/dev/".
 Also recognized:
  pty[NUM] - pseudotty's.
  vty[NUM] - virtual ttys.
  sio[NUM] - serial lines.
  
 While running interactive, all user input discarded except :
  Ctrl+C - Exit watch.
  Ctrl+X - Change attached tty.
  Ctrl+W - Clear screen.
