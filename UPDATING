This file is maintainted by imp@village.org.  Please send new entries
in it to him.  It contains a list, in reverse chronologocal order, of
major breakages in tracking -current.  Not all things will be listed
here, and it only starts on Novemeber 18, 1998.  If you have an
earlier version of FreeBSD, you are on your own to get to November 18,
1998.

19990104:
	Information about ELF day (see 19981230) can be found in
	  http://www.freebsd.org/~peter/elfday.html
	about the upcoming change, its motivations and instructions
	for doing the upgrade.

19981230:
	You should install new bootblocks now.  The ELF kernel will
	become default soon.  In addition, you'll need to upgrade
	your userland programs to ELF before then as well.  Use
	make aout-to-elf to upgrade your userland programs (old
	a.out programs in, for example, /usr/local/bin will
	continue to work, even after the upgrade).  See src/Makefile
	for more details.

19981202:
	New groups from 19981201 commented out of mtree, so they
	aren't strictly needed, but still a good idea to have.

19981201:
	New user/group added: bind.  From src/etc/master.passwd and
	src/etc/group:
		% grep <newstuff> /usr/src/etc/group 
		bind:*:53:
		% grep <newstuff> /usr/src/etc/master.passwd 
		tty:*:4:65533::0:0:Tty Sandbox:/:/sbin/nologin
		kmem:*:5:65533::0:0:KMem Sandbox:/:/sbin/nologin
		bind:*:53:53::0:0:Bind Sandbox:/:/sbin/nologin

19981118:
	PAM integrated into the tree.   Requires new /etc/pam.conf file
	to silence warnings from authentication programs (login, etc).
	See src/etc/pam.conf for a sample.

YYYYMMDD:
	What happened and what you need to do.
