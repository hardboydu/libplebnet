	The ISA and PCI compatability shims have been connected to the
	options COMPAT_OLDISA and COMPAT_OLDPCI.  If you are using old
	style PCI or ISA drivers (i.e. tx, voxware, etc.) you must
	include the appropriate option in your kernel config.  Drivers
	using the shims should be updated or they won't ship with
	5.0-RELEASE, targeted for 2001.

20000318:
	We've entered the tradtional post release dumping party.
	Large kernel changes are being committed and are in the

	in sync as kernel interfaces and structures are changing.
	Before reporting kernel panics, make sure that all modules
	that you are loading are up to date.
