<h1>Updating Information for FreeBSD current users</h1>
<p>
This file is maintainted by <a href="mailto:imp@village.org">Warner
Losh</a>.  Please send new entries in it to him.  It contains a list,
in reverse chronologocal order, of major breakages in tracking
-current.  Not all things will be listed here, and it only starts on
Novemeber 18, 1998.  If you have an earlier version of FreeBSD, you
are on your own to get to November 18, 1998.</P>

	New keyboard and video card drivers are introduced as the first
	stage of console driver reorganization.  You are required to
	update the kernel configuration file and rebuild the kernel.
	kbdcontrol, vidcontrol, and screen savers also need recompilation.
	The instruction can be found in

	Robert Nordier was kind enough to make this page to enable people to
	install the new bootblocks:

    <p>
	When updating to ELF, make sure that you have updated your
	/etc/rc files which have different ldconfig invocations for
	elf and aout.  Otherwise things like X will stop working with
	messages about being unable to find library files.  The
	mergemaster utility in ports/sysutils/mergemaster helps to
	keep critical files like this in sync, and its use is
	recommended.

	You should install new bootblocks now.  The ELF kernel will
	become default soon.  In addition, you'll need to upgrade
	your userland programs to ELF before then as well.  Use
	make aout-to-elf to upgrade your userland programs (old
	a.out programs in, for example, /usr/local/bin will
	continue to work, even after the upgrade).  See src/Makefile
	for more details.

	The old wcd driver has been deleted from the kernel.  The
	driver that replaces it is named acd.  You'll need to change
	this in your configuration files.
    <p>
	Failure to do this will result in "ATAPI CD-ROMs not
	configured" at boot time.
    <p>
	The floppy tape driver (ft) has been removed from the kernel,
	with no replacement driver.

	New groups from 19981201 commented out of mtree, so they
	aren't strictly needed, but still a good idea to have.

	New user/group added: bind.  From src/etc/master.passwd and
	src/etc/group:
    <pre>
		% grep <newstuff> /usr/src/etc/group 
		bind:*:53:
		% grep <newstuff> /usr/src/etc/master.passwd 
		tty:*:4:65533::0:0:Tty Sandbox:/:/sbin/nologin

	PAM integrated into the tree.   Requires new /etc/pam.conf file
	to silence warnings from authentication programs (login, etc).
	See src/etc/pam.conf for a sample.
