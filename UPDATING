of file for further details.  For commonly done items, please see the
COMMON ITEMS: section later in the file.

20020112:
	The preferred configuration method for PAM is now /etc/pam.d/
	rather than /etc/pam.conf.  If you have an unmodified
	pam.conf, just delete it after your next mergemaster run.  If
	you have local modifications, you can use
	/usr/src/etc/pam.d/convert.pl to incorporate them into your
	/etc/pam.d.

	Please see the following url for more details:
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/mid.cgi?db=mid&id=<xzp6667fyoa.fsf@flood.ping.uio.no>

20011229:
	If anyone here is already using the new rc.conf(5) variable
	networkfs_types, please note that it has changed
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/mid.cgi?db=mid&id=<9744.1009655556@axl.seasidesoftware.co.za>

20011209:
	The bugs in procfs' debugging support code have been fixed,
	and truss(1) now works again.

20011207:
	Daily security checks have been split out to use the periodic(8)
	scripts.  Some change in configuration may be necessary.  Please
	see 
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/mid.cgi?db=mid&id=<20011207155805.R8975@blossom.cjclark.org>
	for details.

20011204:
	sos added VCD/SVCD support to ata driver and that needs the
	kernel and burncd to be in sync.

20011203:
	The procfs pseudo-filesystem has now been converted to use the
	pseudofs framework.  If you have 'options PROCFS' in your
	kernel config, you'll need to add 'options PSEUDOFS' if it's
	not there already.

	This change temporarily breaks truss(1); use ktrace(1) instead
	until the issue has been resolved.

20011202:
	A security hole in OpenSSH involving `UseLogin yes' has been
	patched.

20011126:
	You need to remove /usr/obj/.../usr.bin/tip before rebuilding
	after this date.  You need to do this only once.

20011103:
	Most of the awk issues have been resolved.  Some rough
	edges may be left, but for the most part things should be
	back to "normal." For CURRENT's usual definition of "normal."

20011030:
	Awk has been upgraded to the one true awk from bell labs.  Expect
	choppy waves in the upgrade process.

20011030:
	The asr driver problem has been resolved.

20011027:
	Due to changes in other parts of the system, the asr driver
	now causes the system to panic on boot.  Do not use it pending
	correction.  Comment it out of any kernel config file that you
	try to use from this date forward.

20011025:
	When crossbuilding, use TARGET=xxx where you used to use
	MACHINE=xxx.  You don't need to set TARGET_ARCH and TARGET,
	unless you are changing both of them.  To cross build pc98 on
	an alpha, for example, you need to set TARGET=pc98 and
	TARGET_ARCH=i386.

20011001:
	The kernel interface that burncd depends on has changed.
	You must recompile both the kernel and userland applications
	at the same time.

20010929:
	When crossbuilding, please set TARGET_ARCH rather than
	MACHINE_ARCH to indicate the target.  In the future, one will
	set TARGET_MACHINE where you set MACHINE now.  At the moment,
	setting MACHINE alone for same MACHINE_ARCH machines works
	(eg, you can build pc98 on a i386 machine and vice versa).

20010927:
	Some weird problems result from using ACPI on some machines.
	To disable ACPI you can add
		hint.acpi.0.disable="1"
	to /boot/loader.conf (or by putting set X=Y at the boot
	loader "ok" prompt).

	Alternatively, you can remove it from /boot/kernel/acpi.ko
	or use the MODULES_OVERRIDE function in your kernel config
	file and not list acpi in that list.

20010924:
	The buildworld has been fixed.  You may need to install
	the 4.x compatibility libraries for some old binaries
	to work.  Add COMPAT4X=true to your /etc/make.conf to
	get them installed on every installworld, or execute the
	following to get them installed only once:
		cd src/lib/compat/compat4x.<arch>
		make all install
	You will see ``__stdoutp undefined'' until you do this.

20010919:
	There's a bug in the world build process.  The cross-tools
	are build with the NEW headers, but the OLD libc.a.  This
	leads to all kinds of problems with the new libc.  A temporary
	workaround is to add
		CFLAGS="-O -pipe -D_OLD_STDIO"
	before building world when upgrading from 4.x to current.  This
	can be removed afterwards.

	A proper fix to the buildworld target is needed.

20010918:
	Peter has committed his new kthread nfs client/server code.
	NFS may be unstable after this date.

20010912:
	KSE has hit the tree.  Lots of things are now different in
	the kernel.  While a few problems were introduced in the
	initial commit, most of the major ones have been found and
	corrected.

20010901:
	In OLDCARD, CardBus bridges appear to be stable.  The work
	arounds described in the 20010604 entry are now no longer
	necessary and will be ignored.  Most insert/remove problems
	have been rectified around this date.

20010823:
 	named now runs as user bind and group bind rather than as 
 	root.  If named_enable is set to YES in /etc/rc.conf, ensure 
 	that user bind is available in /etc/passwd (using vipw(8)) 
 	and that group bind is available in /etc/group.  Also make 
 	sure that user or group bind has read (and not write) 
 	permission for your name server configuration and that it 
 	has read and write permission for your slave zone files and 
 	directory.
 
 	If you wish to continue to run named as root (a less secure 
 	alternative), add a line to /etc/rc.conf saying
 
 		named_flags=

20010709:
	The PAM libraries have had an API upgrade that is beyond
	the ability of the shared library major number to handle.
	It is manifested by PAM-using ports dumping core. The
	solution is to rebuild those ports.

20010628:
	The kernel compile module has moved from src/sys/compile/FOO
	to src/sys/${MACHINE}/compile/FOO.

20010625:
	The pccard modem issue from 20010613 has been corrected.
	OLDCARD support is still a little weak in -current.  slot 1 is
	known not to work on some TI based cardbus bridges.  Some
	cardbus bridges do not properly detect insert/removal events.
	IRQ configuration needs more safety belts.

20010617:
	Softupdates problems have been corrected.

20010614:
	Peter ripped out the linkerset support.  You must, as always,
	rerun config after you cvsup if you are using the traditional
	kernel building methods.

20010613:
	pccard modems may not work with current after 20010604 date.  Some
	do, others result in panics.  *MAKE*SURE* that you update your
	config and /etc/rc.conf ala the 20010604 entry, or you will have
	problems (this issue will be fixed, it just hasn't been yet).

20010613:
	SOFTUPDATES seem to be broken since the middle of May or so.  Do not
	use them in current.  You can disable softupdates on all mounted
	partitions, or remove SOFTUPDATES the kernel config file.

20010612:
	After Peter's commits to the hints code, people have been noticing
	that certain devices are attached (or try to) twice.  This is due
	to having both static hints as well as a /boot/device.hints.  To
	work around this issue, please use only one or the other mechanism
	until this bug is fixed.

	Please note that a feature of config is that if you have config
	file FOO and FOO.hints, it automatically adds FOO.hints to the
	hints.c file, wheather you want it to or not.

20010610:
	Locale names have changed to match other systems better.

20010604:
	pccard support for pci cards has been committed.  You must change
	your /etc/pccard.conf irq lines.  It must match the irq used by
	pcic device.  Interrupt storms may result if you fail to do this.
	Interrupt storms look a lot like a hang.

	You must also install a new pccardd, otherwise you will get an
	interrupt storm at card reset time (just after it tells you what
	it is).

	pccardd_flags="-I" is necessary for the time being.  It tells pccardd
	not to ask the kernel if the interrupt is really free or not before
	using it.  You can either change the /etc/pccard.conf irq lines to
	match pcic, or add "-i X" to the pccardd_flags.

20010530:
	INSTALL=install -C is being deprecated.  If you want to do this,
	use COPY=-C instead.  The former method will be supported for only
	a limited time.  If you see

install: warning: the -d and -C options may not be specified together

	in your makeworld, then you need to migrate towards using
	COPY=-C.

20010525:
	It appears that vm is now stable enough to use again.  However,
	there may be other problems, so caution is still urged.  alpha
	definitely is in bad shape.

20010521:
	Minor repo damange has happened.  This may cause problems
	with cvsup of ports.  If you get errors, please see
	http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=27495
	at the bottom for details on a workaround.  The error message
	is
Updater failed: Cannot delete "/usr/ports/www/jakarta-tomcat/files": Directory not empty

20010520:
	Vm and/or swapping are busted on -current.  Please be patient.

20010519:
	pccard has had much reorganizational work done to it over
	the past few days.  Everything should still work, but if
	not, please contact imp@freebsd.org.

20010517:
	ata ioctl changed.  Make sure to recompile both kernel and
	userland at the same time.

20010517:
	New ncurses imported.

20010512:
	DEVFS is now opt out, not opt in.  Barring major problems, this
	will be the only way to go starting July 1.

20010502:
	Perl breakage in 20010501 was corrected at 14:18:33 PDT.

20010501:
	Building perl was broken at 02:25:25 PDT.

20010430:
	The bug in 20010429 was corrected at 07:35:37 PDT.  It is safe to
	go back in the water.

20010429:
	A bad bug was committed at 04:48:42 PDT.  Don't use kernels after
	this date, but before the correction date.

20010423:
	old fsck and new kernel interactions appear to have been fixed.

20010411:
	fsck and the kernel were changed to handle some optimizations
	to directory layout.  This breaks backward compatibility.
	Update only if you understand that you must not use the old
	fsck with the new kernel ever.

20010330:
	fsck has changed the meaning of the pass column in /etc/fstab.
	Please see the cvs commit to fsck.8 or the fsck.8 man page for
	details.  It is unclear if changes to /etc/fstab are necessary.

20010319:
	portmap had changed name to rpcbind for maximum POLA in your
	current world.  /etc/hosts.{allow,deny} needs changes.  nfs and
	other rpc based programs that rely on portmapper will not work
	without updates to /etc/hosts.{allow,deny} and /etc/netconfig.

20010315:
	ata subsystem changes.  ATA_ENABLE_ATAPI_DMA, ATA_ENABLE_WC
	and ATA_ENABEL_TAGS are no longer kernel options.  They have
	been replaced by tunables.  See ata.4 for details.

20010312:
	The fxp driver was converted to use miibus.  If you compile
	fxp into your kernel statically, you will need to add miibus.

20010312:
	The wi device now defaults to BSS (infrastructure) mode
	instead of ad-hoc.

20010310:
	/dev/urandom should be a symbolic link to /dev/random now.
	Users of current not using DEVFS need to run MAKEDEV std.
	ssh might not work if you don't.

20010303:
	The ed driver has been updated.  It now allows mii attachments,
	which means that you must include the miibus in your kernel if
	you use the ed driver.

20010220:
	The problems with libc have been corrected.  It is now mostly
	safe to go back into the water.

20010211:
	The size of FILE was changed.  This breaks upgrading.  If
	you must upgrade, be prepared for pain.  It also breaks almost
	all binaries that you've compiled on -current.  You are warned
	that before upgrading would be a good time to do a level 0
	dump of your system.  No, really, I mean it this time.

	To get to the new system, you'll need to use the following
	workaround.  Hopefully this can be sorted out so that we
	don't have to move this to the updating section.

	To get around the installworld problem, do:
		# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/sed
		# make install
		# cd /usr/src
		# make installworld
	If that doesn't work, then try:
		# make -k installworld
		# make installworld

20010207:
	DEVFS is now the default.  If you use vinum, make sure that you
	do not include devfs in your kernel as problems result.

20010205:
	FFS_ROOT and CD9660_ROOT have been removed or deprecated.
	Remove them from your config.

20010122:
	****************************** WARNING ******************************
			buildkernel has been changed slightly
	****************************** WARNING ******************************
	KERNCONF replaces the variable KERNEL for buildkernel.  You
	should update your scripts and make.conf accordingly.

20010119:
	config has changed to allow DEV_FOO as a replacement for NFOO.
	This requires a new config to build correctly.

20010116:
	The kerrnel option I386_CPU is now mutually exclusive with the
	other cpu types. If you have an i386 system, be sure that it
	only had this line.  Remove it for all other configurations.

20010110:
	Changes to the kernel require it and burncd be in sync.

20010102:
	Everyone who has hw.sndunit set to something in
	/etc/sysctl.conf, it is now hw.snd.unit.

20010101:
	ex and vi were broken by some changes to sys/queue.h.  If you
	have a bad vi, you will see make buildworld fail with a core
	dump while building termcap.  You can work around this problem
	by adding -k to your make buildworld.  This will cause the
	build to complete and install a new vi.  Once that's done, you
	can rebuild again without the -k to pick up anything that
	might have been ignored by the -k option.

	Others have suggested that you can just rebuild libc if your
	vi/ex is dynamically linked, but I've not received any reports
	of this working.

20001228:
	There have been some changes to libcrypt in -current.  The
	libscrypt/libdescrypt symlink sillyness is gone and the installed
	libcrypt is fully functional.  Be aware of this.

20001218:
	Linksys Fast Ethernet PCCARD cards supported by the ed driver
	now require the addition of flag 0x80000 to their config line
	in pccard.conf(5).  This flag is not optional.  These Linksys
	cards will not be recognized without it.

20001205:
	Important new FreeBSD-version stuff: PAM support has been worked
	in, partially from the "Unix" OpenSSH version.  This requires
	adding the following in pam.conf:
  
	sshd    auth    sufficient      pam_skey.so
	sshd    auth    required        pam_unix.so         try_first_pass
	sshd    session required        pam_permit.so

20001031:
	cvs updated to 1.11.

20001020:
	The random device needs more entropy, so you need to make sure
	that you've run mergemaster to get a /etc/rc which will seed
	/dev/random.  If you don't and the system hangs after ldconfig,
	then banging on the keyboard randomly until it unhangs is one
	workaround.

20001010:
	****************************** WARNING ******************************
				Sendmail has been updated.
	****************************** WARNING ******************************
	o mail.local(8) is no longer installed as a set-user-id binary.
	o sendmail(8) is now built with STARTTLS support unless NO_OPENSSL
	  is set.
	o The default /etc/mail/sendmail.cf disables the SMTP EXPN and VRFY
	  commands.
	o Now using sendmail's version of vacation(1).
	o The sendmail cf building tools (contrib/sendmail/cf) are installed
	  in /usr/share/sendmail/cf.
	o sendmail.cw changed to local-host-names

	More details can be found at
		http://people.freebsd.org/~imp/UPDATING/sendmail-20001010

20001009:
	The ports tree's new layout is in place.  Be sure to update
	your entire ports tree, or you will have problems.

20001006:
	The perl build procedure no longer installs miniperl, nor uses
	the installed miniperl.  It is recommended that you delete
	/usr/bin/miniperl.

20001005:
	This weekend the ports tree will be updated to a new layout.
	It will be in an inconsistent state until noted in the UPDATING
	file, or with asami-san's message to the relevant mailing
	lists.  With this new layout, you'll need to update the whole
	tree for anything to work.

20000928:
	There was a change in the passwd format.  Need more information.

20000916:
	/boot/kernel/kernel.ko -> /boot/kernel/kernel change has taken
	place.  Please update boot loader (not the boot blocks) at the
	same time as your kernel.

20000914:
	The new pmtimer device is necessary for laptops.  Failure to
	include the device will cause suspended laptops losing time
	when they resume.  Include
		device		pmtimer
	in your config file and
		hint.pmtimer.0.at="isa"
	to your /boot/device.hints file.

20000911:
	The random device has been turned into a (pseudo-)device,
	rather than an option. The supplied kernel config files have
	been updated. You will need to do something similar in your
	own kernel config file.
	Remove:
		options		RANDOMDEV
	Add:
		device		random
	If you prefer to load the loadable module, you need to do
	nothing.

20000909:
	The random device module has been renamed from randomdev.ko to
	random.ko. You will need to edit your /boot/loader.conf to
	reflect this if you load this module at boot time.
	The line should read:
		random_load="YES"

20000907:
	The SMPNG commit has happened.  It should work, but if it
	doesn't, fallback to the PRE_SMPNG CVS tag.  There are likely
	to be a variety of minor issues.  Please see 20000905 to make
	sure you don't have model loading problems which might at
	first blush appear related to SMP.

20000906:
	nsswitch has been imported from NetBSD.  Among other things,
	this means that /etc/host.conf is no longer used.  See
	nsswitch.conf(5) instead.  Note that at boot time rc.network
	will attempt to produce a new nsswitch.conf file for you if you
	don't have one, and you have host.conf.

20000905:
	The ucred structure changed size.  This breaks the interface
	that mountd uses.  Trying to use an older mountd with a newer
	kernel guarantees a panic.  This means that you need to use
	kernels newer than today only with matching mountd, but you
	needed to do that anyway with the boot loader changes.

20000905:
	The boot loader has been updated.  The new default kernel is
	now /boot/kernel/kernel.ko.  The new default module location
	is /boot/kernel.

	You *MUST* upgrade your boot loader and kernel at the same time.
	The easiest way to do this is to do the buildworld/buildkernel/
	installkernel/installworld dance.

	Furthermore, you are urged to delete your old /modules directory
	before booting the new kernel, since kldload will find stale
	modules in that directory instead of finding them in the correct
	path, /boot/kernel.  The most common complaint that this cures
	is that the linux module crashes your machine after the update.

	if [ ! -d /boot/kernel.old ]; then
		mv /modules.old /boot/kernel.old
		chflags noschg /kernel.old
		mv /kernel.old /boot/kernel.old/kernel.ko
		chflags schg /boot/kernel.old/kernel.ko
	fi

20000904:
	A new issue with the sendmail upgrade has come to light.
	/etc/aliases has moved to /etc/mail/aliases.  Mergemaster will 
	incorrectly install the default aliases in /etc/mail rather than
	move the old one from /etc.  So you'll need to manually move the
	file, create a symbolic link, remove the old /etc/aliases.db and
	run newaliases.  For safety sake, you should stop sendmail
	while doing this and run the upgrade when locally sourced email
	is not likely to be generated.

20000825:
	/boot/device.hints is now required for installkernel to
	succeed.  You should copy GENERIC.hints for your architecture
	into /boot/device.hints.  If and only if you compile hints
	into your kernel, then this file may be empty.  Please note,
	if you have an empty or missing /boot/device.hints file and
	you neglected to compile hints into your kernel, no boot
	messages will appear after the boot loader tries to start the
	kernel.

20000821:
	If you do NOT have ``options RANDOMDEV'' in your kernel and
	you DO want the random device then add randomdev_load="YES" to
	/boot/loader.conf.

20000812:
	suidperl is now always built and installed on the system, but
	with permissions of 511.  If you have applications that use
	this program, you are now required to add ENABLE_SUIDPERL=true
	to /etc/make.conf.  If you forget to do this,
		chmod 4511 /usr/bin/suidperl
	will fix this until the next build.

20000812:
	sendmail has been updated from 8.9.3 to 8.11.0.  Some of the more
	visible changes that may immediately affect your configuration
	include:
	- New default file locations from src/contrib/sendmail/cf/README
	- newaliases limited to root and trusted users
	- MSA port (587) turned on by default
	- New queue file naming system so can't go from 8.11 -> 8.9
	- FEATURE(`rbl') renamed to FEATURE(`dnsbl')
	- FEATURE(`nullclient') is more full featured
	- FEATURE(`nouucp') requires an argument: `reject' or `nospecial'
	- mail.local FreeBSD-only -b option changed to -B
	- See src/contrib/sendmail/RELEASE_NOTES for more info

20000810:
	suidperl (aka sperl) is no longer build by default.  You must
	specifically define BUILD_SUIDPERL to "true" for it to be build.
	Furthermore, we recommend that you remove /usr/bin/sperl* and
	/usr/bin/suidperl files from your system unless you have a
	specific use for it.

20000729:
	Networking defaults have been tightened.  Anybody upgrading
	/etc/defaults/rc.conf needs to add the following lines to
	/etc/rc.conf if they want to have the same setup
	afterwards (unless the variables already are set, of course):
		# Enable network daemons for user convenience.
		inetd_enable="YES"
		portmap_enable="YES"
		sendmail_enable="YES"

20000728:
	If you have null_load="YES" in your /boot/loader.conf, you
	will need to change that to nullfs_load="YES".

20000728:
	The "installkernel" target has changed slightly. Now even if
	you override KERNEL e.g. 'make installkernel KERNEL=MYKERNEL'
	it will install the MYKERNEL file (built with the buildkernel
	target) as /kernel rather than /MYKERNEL. Those who have
	updated their /boot/loader.conf files to point to /MYKERNEL
	should remove that entry or perform manual rename of /kernel
	to /MYKERNEL.

20000711:
	If you use CVSUP or CTM to get CVS trees, AND you used to get 
	the old crypto files from internat.freebsd.org AND you check
	out files from the CVS tree with the cvs command, please read
		http://people.freebsd.org/~imp/internat.txt
	for details on potential problems that you might have and how
	to get around them.

	If you are merely a mirror, or don't answer yes to each of the
	clauses above, you needn't worry.

20000711:
	/etc/security has been updated to print the inode number of
	setuid programs that have changed.  You will see a large spike
	in the number of changed programs the first time when you run
	mergemaster to get a new /etc/security.

20000710:
	/dev/random now has good entropy collection (from the keyboard
	and sysmouse drivers). Please ensure that either `options
	RANDOMDEV' is present in your kernel config file or that
	`randomdev_load="YES"' is in your /boot/loader.conf. If you do
	not have the /dev/random driver, OpenSSL (and consequently
	lots of crypto tools (like SSH)) will fail with strange
	errors. (see below, 20000624).

	FreeBSD-current is safe again to run Crypto.

20000709:
	phk made the malloc default options AJ.  This may slow things
	down and uncover other latent bugs in the code.  If you need to
	run at full speed, you can disable this by doing the following:
		ln -s aj /etc/malloc.conf

20000706:
	libftpio's version was accidentally bumped a few days ago.  This
	has been corrected.  You may need to remove /usr/lib/libftpio.so.6
	before doing your next buildworld/installworld pair.  It certainly
	won't hurt to remove it before the update procedure.  It will
	break fetch until a new one is built, but ftp can be used in the
	interim if needed.

20000705:
	The crypto packages have changed for the cvsup.  This has been done
	in a backward compatible way, but the old packages will go away at
	some point in the future.  Look at /usr/share/examples/cvsup for
	details.

20000704:
	With the new sys/modules/sound/drivers/*, you will need to
	set SYSDIR until you do an installworld after July 7th.

20000704:
	rc.shutdown and rc will now call the rc.d scripts with start
	or stop.  This may cause some harmless warnings from older
	rc.d scripts that haven't been updated.

20000630:
	The libfetch based version of fetch has gone into the tree.
	Minor problems may result on some of the less popular sites,
	which should be reported to des@freebsd.org.

20000625:
	From approximately this date forward, one must have the crypto
	system installed in order to build the system and kernel.
	While not technically strictly true, one should treat it as
	required and grab the crypto bits.  If you are grabbing CVS
	trees, src-all and cvs-crypto should be treated as if they
	were required.  You should check with the latest collections
	to make sure that these haven't changed.

20000624:
	Mark Murray just committed the first parts of a cleanup of
	/dev/zero, et al.  This is also cleaning up /dev/random.
	The entropy is disconnected, so DO NOT USE VERSIONS OF FREEBSD
	-CURRENT FROM THIS POINT FORWARD for cryptographic services
	until Mark can merge in the fixes to this work in progress.
	openssh and openssl should not be used to generate keys from this
	date to the completion of the work.

	If you must operate at this reduced level of security, add '
	options RANDOMDEV' to your kernel or modload the randomdev
	module.  You may also need to copy a new MAKEDEV to /dev and
	recreate the random and urandom devices.

20000622:
	The license on the softupdates is now a standard 2 clause
	BSD license.  You may need to remove your symbolic links
	that used to be required when updating.

20000621:
	Scott Flatman <sf@aracnet.com> sent in a decent write-up on
	the config file update procedure.
		http://people.freebsd.org/~imp/config-upd.html
	NOTE: LINT is gone.  It has been replaced with NOTES.  NOTES
	isn't buildable.  However, you can generate a LINT file.

20000620:
	Binutils 2.10 have hit the tree, or will shortly.  As soon
	as they do, the problem noted in 20000522 will be resolved and
	that workaround will no longer be required.

20000615:
	phk removed the compatibility creation of wd devices in the
	ad driver.  If you haven't done so already, you must update
	your fstab, etc to use the ad devices instead of the wd
	devices.

	In addition, you'll need to update your boot blocks to a
	more modern version, if you haven't already done so.  Modern
	here means 4.0 release or newer (although older releases
	may work).

20000612:
	Peter took an axe to config(8).  Be sure that you read his mail
	on the topic before even thinking about updating.  You will
	need to create a /boot/device.hints or add a hints directive
	to your config file to compile them in statically.  The format
	of the config file has changed as well.  Please see GENERIC or
	NEWCARD for examples of the new format.

20000522:
	A new set of binutils went into the tree today.  Anybody
	building a kernel after this point is advised that they need
	to rebuild their binutils (or better yet do a
	buildworld/installworld) before building a new kernel.

	Due to bugs in binutils, using malloc options (eg /etc/malloc.conf
	or MALLOC_OPTIONS env var) J will cause ld to dump core.  It
	is recommended that you don't set this option until the problem
	is resolved.

20000513:
	The ethernet drivers were all updated to clean up the BPF handling.

20000510:
	The problems with boot blocks on the alphas have been corrected.
	This will require some care in updating alphas.  A new libstand
	is requires for the boot blocks to build properly.

20000503:
	Recompile all kld modules.  Proper version dependency info
	is now available.

20000502:
	Modules have been disconnected from the buildworld tree and 
	connected to the kernel building instead.

20000427:
	You may need to build gperf
		cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/gperf && make depend all install
	when upgrading from 4.0 -> current.  The build system now uses
	an option only in -current.

20000417:
	The method that we brand ELF binaries has changed to be more
	acceptable to the binutils maintainers.  You will need to
	rebrand your ELF binaries that aren't native.  One problem
	binary is the Linux ldconfig.  After your make world, but
	before you reboot, you'll need to issue:
		brandelf -t Linux /compat/linux/sbin/ldconfig
	if you have Linux compatibility enabled on your machine.

20000320:
	If you have really bad/marginal IDE drives, you may find they
	don't work well.  Use pio mode instead.  The easiest way to
	cope if you have a problem combination is to add:
		/sbin/sysctl -w hw.atamodes=pio,pio,pio,pio
	to the start of /etc/rc.conf.

20000319:
	The ISA and PCI compatibility shims have been connected to the
	options COMPAT_OLDISA and COMPAT_OLDPCI.  If you are using old
	style PCI or ISA drivers (i.e. tx, voxware, etc.) you must
	include the appropriate option in your kernel config.  Drivers
	using the shims should be updated or they won't ship with
	5.0-RELEASE, targeted for 2001.

20000318:
	We've entered the traditional post release dumping party.
	Large kernel changes are being committed and are in the
	works.  It is important to keep the systems' klds and kernel
	in sync as kernel interfaces and structures are changing.
	Before reporting kernel panics, make sure that all modules
	that you are loading are up to date.

20000315:
	If you are upgrading from an older version of FreeBSD, you
	need to update your boot blocks as well.  'disklabel -B ad0'
	will do the trick.  This isn't critical until you remove your
	wd device entries in /dev, at which point your system will not
	boot.

20000315:
	4.0 RELEASE shipped.  Please see the 4.0 UPDATING file for how
	to upgrade to 4.0 from 3.x.

COMMON ITEMS:

	General Notes
	-------------
	Avoid using make -j when upgrading.  From time to time in the
	past there have been problems using -j with buildworld and/or
	installworld.  This is especially true when upgrading between
	"distant" versions (eg one that cross a major release boundary
	or several minor releases, or when several months have passed
	on the -current branch).

	Sometimes, obscure build problems are the result of environment
	poisoning.  This can happen because the make utility reads its
	environment when searching for values for global variables.
	To run your build attempts in an "environmental clean room",
	prefix all make commands with 'env -i '.  See the env(1) manual
	page for more details.

	To build a kernel
	-----------------
	If you are updating from a prior version of FreeBSD (even one just
	a few days old), you should follow this procedure. With a
	/usr/obj tree with a fresh buildworld,
	make buildkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
	make installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE

	To just build a kernel when you know that it won't mess you up
	--------------------------------------------------------------
	cd src/sys/{i386,alpha}/conf
	config KERNEL_NAME_HERE
	cd ../../compile/KERNEL_NAME_HERE
	make depend
	make
	make install	

	If this fails, go to the "To build a kernel" section.

	To rebuild everything and install it on the current system.
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	make world
	Build a new kernel, see above.

	To upgrade from 4.x-stable to current
	-------------------------------------
	make buildworld
	make buildkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
	cp src/sys/${MACHINE_ARCH}/conf/GENERIC.hints /boot/device.hints [2]
	make installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
	reboot in single user [3]
	make installworld
	mergemaster		[4]
	[1]
	<reboot>

	Make sure that you've read the UPDATING file to understand the
	tweaks to various things you need.  At this point in the life
	cycle of current, things change often and you are on your own
	to cope.  The defaults can also change, so please read ALL of
	the UPDATING entries.

	Also, if you are tracking -current, you must be subscribed to
	freebsd-current@freebsd.org.  Make sure that before you update
	your sources that you have read and understood all the recent
	messages there.  If in doubt, please track -stable which has
	much fewer pitfalls.

	[1] If you have third party modules, such as vmware, you
	should disable them at this point so they don't crash your
	system on reboot.

	[2] If you have legacy ISA devices, you may need to create
	your own device.hints to reflect your unique hardware
	configuration.

	[3] From the bootblocks, boot -s, and then do
		fsck -p
		mount -u /
		mount -a
		cd /usr/src
		adjkerntz -i		# if CMOS is wall time

	[4] Note: This step is non-optional.  Failure to do this step
	can result in a significant reduction in the functionality of the
	system.  Attempting to do it by hand is not recommended and those
	that pursue this avenue should read this file carefully, as well
	as the archives of freebsd-current and freebsd-hackers mailing lists
	for potential gotchas.

FORMAT:

This file contains a list, in reverse chronological order, of major
breakages in tracking -current.  Not all things will be listed here,
and it only starts on March 15, 2000.  Updating files can found in
previous releases if your system is older than this.

Please filter your entries through Warner Losh (imp@village.org) so
that the style, formatting, etc of this file can be maintained.
