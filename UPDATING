ITEMS:'

20000513:
	The ethernet drivers were all updated to clean up the BPF handling.

2000510:
	The problems with boot blocks on the alphas have been corrected.
	This will require some care in updating alphas.  A new libstand
	is requires for the boot blocks to build properly.

20000502:
	Modules have been disconnected from the buildworld tree and 
	connected to the kernel building instead.

20000503:
	Recompile all kld modules.  Proper version dependency info
	is now available.

2000427:
	You may need to build gperf
		cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/gperf &&make depend all install
	when upgrading from 4.0 -> current.  The build system now uses
	an option only in -current.


20000417:
	The method that we brand ELF binaries has changed to be more
	acceptible to the binutils maintainers.  You will need to
	rebrand your ELF binaries that aren't native.  One problem
	binary is the Linux ldconfig.  After your make world, but
	before you reboot, you'll neeed to issue:
		brandelf -t Linux /compat/linux/sbin/ldconfig
	if you have Linux compatibility enabled on your machine.

20000320:
	If you have really bad/marginal IDE drives, you may find they
	don't work well.  Use pio mode instead.  The easiest way to
	cope if you have a problem combination is to add:
		/sbin/sysctl -w hw.atamodes=pio,pio,pio,pio
	to the start of /etc/rc.conf.

20000319:
	The ISA and PCI compatability shims have been connected to the
	options COMPAT_OLDISA and COMPAT_OLDPCI.  If you are using old
	style PCI or ISA drivers (i.e. tx, voxware, etc.) you must
	include the appropriate option in your kernel config.  Drivers
	using the shims should be updated or they won't ship with
	5.0-RELEASE, targeted for 2001.

20000318:
	We've entered the tradtional post release dumping party.
	Large kernel changes are being committed and are in the
	works.  It is important to keep the systems' klds and kernel
	in sync as kernel interfaces and structures are changing.
	Before reporting kernel panics, make sure that all modules
	that you are loading are up to date.

20000315:
	If you are upgrading from an older version of FreeBSD, you
	need to update your boot blocks as well.  'disklabel -B ad0'
	will do the trick.  This isn't critical until you remove your
	wd device entries in /dev, at which point your system will not
	boot.

20000315:
	4.0 RELEASE shipped.  Please see the 4.0 UPDATING file for how
	to upgrade to 4.0 from 3.x.

COMMON ITEMS:

	To build a kernel
	-----------------
	Update config, genassym and go:
		config YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
		cd ../../compile/YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
		make depend && make
		make install

	To rebuild everything
	---------------------
	make world

FORMAT:

This file contains a list, in reverse chronologocal order, of major
breakages in tracking -current.  Not all things will be listed here,
and it only starts on March 15, 2000.  Updating files can found in
previous releases if your system is older than this.

Please filter your entries through Warner Losh (imp@village.org) so
that the style, formatting, etc of this file can be maintained.
