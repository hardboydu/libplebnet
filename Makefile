# The user-driven targets are:
#
# buildworld          - Rebuild *everything*, including glue to help do
#                       upgrades.
# installworld        - Install everything built by "buildworld".
# world               - buildworld + installworld.
# buildkernel         - Rebuild the kernel and the kernel-modules.
# installkernel       - Install the kernel and the kernel-modules.
# reinstallkernel     - Reinstall the kernel and the kernel-modules.
# kernel		buildkernel + installkernel
# update              - Convenient way to update your source tree (cvs).
# upgrade             - Upgrade a.out (2.2.x/3.0) system to the new ELF way
# most                - Build user commands, no libraries or include files.
# installmost         - Install user commands, no libraries or include files.
# aout-to-elf         - Upgrade an system from a.out to elf format (see below).
# aout-to-elf-build   - Build everything required to upgrade a system from
#                       a.out to elf format (see below).
# aout-to-elf-install - Install everything built by aout-to-elf-build (see
#                       below).
# move-aout-libs      - Move the a.out libraries into an aout sub-directory
#                       of each elf library sub-directory.
#
# This makefile is simple by design. The FreeBSD make automatically reads
# the /usr/share/mk/sys.mk unless the -m argument is specified on the 
# command line. By keeping this makefile simple, it doesn't matter too
# much how different the installed mk files are from those in the source
# tree. This makefile executes a child make process, forcing it to use
# the mk files from the source tree which are supposed to DTRT.
#
# The user-driven targets (as listed above) are implemented in Makefile.inc0
# and the private targets are in Makefile.inc1. These are kept separate
# to help the bootstrap build from aout to elf format.
#
# For novices wanting to build from current sources, the simple instructions
# are:
#
# 1.  Ensure that your /usr/obj directory has at least 260 Mb of free space.
# 2.  `cd /usr/src'  (or to the directory containing your source tree).
# 3.  `make world'
#
# Be warned, this will update your installed system, except for configuration
# files in the /etc directory and for the kernel. You have to do those manually.
#
# If at first you're a little nervous about having a `make world' update
# your system, a `make buildworld' will build everything in the /usr/obj
# tree without touching your installed system. To be of any further use
# though, a `make installworld' is required.
#
# If -DWANT_AOUT is specified, a `make world' with OBJFORMAT=elf will
# update the legacy support for aout. This includes all libraries, ld.so
# and boot objects. This part of build should be regarded as
# deprecated and you should _not_ expect to be able to do this past the
# release of 4.0. You have exactly one major release to move entirely
# to elf.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#           Upgrading an i386 system from a.out to elf format
#
#
# The aout->elf transition build is performed by doing a `make upgrade' (or
# `make aout-to-elf') or in two steps by a `make aout-to-elf-build' followed
# by a `make aout-to-elf-install', depending on user preference.
# You need to have at least 320 Mb of free space for the object tree.
#
# The upgrade process checks the installed release. If this is 3.0-CURRENT,
# it is assumed that your kernel contains all the syscalls required by the
# current sources.
#
# The upgrade procedure will stop and ask for confirmation to proceed
# several times. On each occasion, you can type Ctrl-C to abort the
# upgrade.  Optionally, you can also start it with NOCONFIRM=yes and skip
# the confirmation steps.
#
# At the end of the upgrade procedure, /etc/objformat is created or
# updated to contain OBJFORMAT=elf. From then on, you're elf by default.
