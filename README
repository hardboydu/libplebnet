This install procedure is ALPHA code, and        `--{__________)
may very possibly *DESTROY* the contents of your
ENTIRE DISK!  Please do not proceed with this installation
unless you've adequately backed up your data first!

If any errors occur during this installation, you can see them
by toggling over to the alternate screen - type ALT-F2 to switch
over, ALT-F1 to switch back to the install screen.  The debugging
output on the second screen may be very valuable to us in understanding
your bug report, so please be sure to take note of it when reporting
any failures in the installation!  Thanks!

Menus and scrolling output windows may be traversed with the arrow
and Page Up/Page Down keys.  To abort the installation at any point,
hit ESC twice.  Hitting TAB will move the focus to different controls.
If you've ever dealt with a DOS installation, you'll know how to deal
with this.
