This file lists hardware, which doesn't do what it should do.

All entries have a date and a mail-address associated with them, this 
reflects when and by who they were added.

For multifunctional devices, please indicate if other parts of the device
work OK, or are untested.
For mutual incompabilities, list both devices.
For IDE-disks, list the string seen on boot of FreeBSD, if possible, and
trade name.
