$FreeBSD$

This directory contains gdb macros for kernel debugging.  When you
build a debug kernel, the target "gdbinit" in the kernel Makefile will
create the correct .gdbinit files in the kernel build directory.  To
perform kernel debugging, you would do:

  # cd /usr/obj/usr/src/sys/GENERIC  (or name of kernel config)
  # make gdbinit
  # gdb kernel.debug
  This GDB was configured as "i386-undermydesk-freebsd"...
  Ready to go.  Enter 'tr' to connect to remote target
  and 'getsyms' after connection to load kld symbols.
