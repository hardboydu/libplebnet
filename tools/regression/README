This directory is for regression test programs.

A regression test program is one that will exercise a particular bit of the
system to check that we have not reintroduced an old bug.

Tests that are for parts of the base system should go into a directory here
which is the same as their path relative to src/, for example the uuencode(1)
utility resides in src/usr.bin/uuencode so its regression test resides in
src/tools/regression/usr.bin/uuencode.

Please make a subdir per other regression test, and add a brief description to
this file.

nfsmmap		Some tests to exercise some tricky cases in NFS and mmap
