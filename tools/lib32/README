# $FreeBSD$

This script is a stopgap for building tuned 32 bit (but i386 ABI compatable)
libraries for amd64 systems.  We *know* we have things like CMOV, SSE2 etc
so take advantage of it.

At some point libc would be configured to use the fast syscall/sysret
instructions (instead of int 0x80) since we have a known minimum feature
set and don't have to do runtime tests for it.

libpthread could use the amd64 sysarch syscalls for setting %fs/%gs
since we don't have USER_LDT.  This would be a heck of a lot easier than
trying to run a real i386-built libc/libpthread.

Again, this hack is a stopgap until something is integrated into world.
