# The device name may be specified as "*", in which case all devices are
# checked.

# The size may be specified as "*", in which case the size is automatically
# determined from the disklabel.

# One of either "Days" or "Rate" must be specified, to specify a complete
# scan should happen once every n days, or that scanning should take place
# at n KB/s.  Note that the "Days" value will not cause a scan exactly every
# n days since diskcheckd will always read in power-of-2 size blocks.
