#          Example of ppp.linkup file
#
#
#  This file is checked when PPP establishes a connection.
#  PPP searches the labels in this file as follows:
#
#  1) The label that matches the IP number assigned to our side.
#
#  2) The label specified on the command line to ppp.
#
#  3) If no label has been found, use MYADDR if it exists.

# If we've got 192.244.176.32 as our address, then regard peer as a gateway
# to 192.244.176.0 network.
#
192.244.176.32:
 add 192.244.176.0 0 HISADDR

# If we are invoked with an argument ``iij-demand'', then delete all
# existing route entries and add the peer as the default gateway.
#
iij-demand:
 delete ALL
 add 0 0 HISADDR

# Otherwise, simply add peer as default gateway.
#
MYADDR:
 add 0 0 HISADDR

# If we are invoked with an argument ``pmdemand'', then
# delete all existing (wrong) routing entries and add the peer IP
# as our default gateway.
# This is vital if you don't already know either sides IP number.
#
# We also want to execute a script on startup.  This script can do
# nice things such as kick off "sendmail -q", "popclient my.isp" and
# "slurp -d news".

pmdemand:
 delete ALL
 add 0 0 HISADDR
