# If we've got 192.244.176.32 as our address, then regard peer as a gateway
# to 192.244.176.0 network.
#
#192.244.176.32:
# add 192.244.176.0 255.255.255.0 HISADDR
#
# If we are invked with an argument ``iij-demand'', then
# delete existing route entry and add peer as default gateway.
#
iij-demand:
 delete ALL
 add 0 0 HISADDR
#
# Otherwide, simply add peer as default gateway.

MYADDR:
 add 0 0 HISADDR
