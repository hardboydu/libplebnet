# This file, if present, will be read by make (see /usr/share/mk/sys.mk).
# It allows you to override macro definitions to make without changing
# your source tree, or anything the source tree installs.
#
# This file must be in valid Makefile syntax.
#
# You have to find the things you can put here in the Makefiles and 
# documentation of the source tree.
#
# One, and probably the most common, use could be:
#
#CFLAGS= -O -pipe
#
#
# Avoid compiling profiled libraries
#NOPROFILE=	true
#
# Compare before install
#INSTALL=install -C
#
# To avoid building perl
#NOPERL=	true
#
# To avoid building the suid perl
#NOSUIDPERL=	true
#
# To build perl with thread support
#PERL_THREADED=	true
#
# To avoid building various parts of the base system:
#NO_CVS=	true	# do not build CVS
#NO_FORTRAN=	true	# do not build g77 and related libraries
#NO_OBJC=	true	# do not build Objective C support
#NO_OPENSSH=	true	# do not build OpenSSH
#NO_OPENSSL=	true	# do not build OpenSSL (implies NO_OPENSSH)
#NO_SENDMAIL=	true	# do not build sendmail and related programs
#NO_SHAREDOCS=	true	# do not build the 4.4BSD legacy docs
#NO_X=		true	# do not compile in XWindows support (e.g. doscmd)
#NOCRYPT=	true	# do not build any crypto code
#NODESCRYPTLINKS=true	# do not replace libcrypt -> libscrypt links
#NOGAMES=	true	# do not build games (games/ subdir)
#NOINFO=	true	# do not make or install info files
#NOLIBC_R=	true	# do not build libc_r (re-entrant version of libc)
#NOSECURE=	true	# do not build crypto code in secure/ subdir
#NOSHARE=	true	# do not go into the share subdir
#NOUUCP=	true	# do not build uucp related programs
#
# To tell the base system that you are using RSAREF (from ports).
# (This needs revisiting) - it is very likely that this is too
# heavily tied to USA_RESIDENT==YES.
#RSAREF=	YES
#
# To avoid running MAKEDEV all on /dev during install:
#NO_MAKEDEV=	true
#
# To compile just the kernel with special optimisations, you should use
# this instead of CFLAGS (which is not applicable to kernel builds anyway):
#
#COPTFLAGS= -O -pipe
#
# To compile and install the 4.4 lite libm instead of the default use:
#
#WANT_CSRG_LIBM=	yes
#
# If you do not want unformatted manual pages to be compressed
# when they are installed:

# builds, uncomment these:

#COMPAT1X=	yes
#COMPAT20=	yes
#COMPAT21=	yes
#COMPAT22=	yes
#COMPAT3X=	yes
#
#
# If you do not want additional documentation (some of which are
# a few hundred KB's) for ports to be installed:
#
#NOPORTDOCS=	true
#
#
# Default format for system documentation, depends on your printer.
# Set this to "ascii" for simple printers or screen
#
#PRINTERDEVICE=	ps
#
#
# How long to wait for a console keypress before booting the default kernel.
# This value is approximately in milliseconds. Keypresses are accepted by the
# BIOS before booting from disk, making it possible to give custom boot
# parameters even when this is set to 0.
#
#BOOTWAIT=0
#BOOTWAIT=30000
#
# By default, the system will always use the keyboard/video card as system
# console.  However, the boot blocks may be dynamically configured to use a
# serial port in addition to or instead of the keyboard/video console.
#
# By default we use COM1 as our serial console port *if* we're going to use
# a serial port as our console at all.  Alter as necessary.

# By default, this points to /usr/X11R6 for XFree86 releases 3.0 or earlier.

#
#X11BASE=	/usr/X386

#
# If you have Motif on your system, uncomment this.
#
#HAVE_MOTIF=	yes
#MOTIF_STATIC=  yes

# If the default location of the Motif library (specified below) is NOT

#MOTIFLIB=	-L${X11BASE}/lib -lXm

#
# If you're resident in the USA, this will help various ports to determine
