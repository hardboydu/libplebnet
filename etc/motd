FreeBSD ?.?.?  (UNKNOWN)

Welcome to FreeBSD!  You will find security advisories and updated
errata information for all releases at http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/

Before asking for technical assistance:
 1.  Consult the ERRATA section for your release at the URL above.

 2.  Search the Handbook, FAQ, and mail archives at 
     http://www.FreeBSD.org/search.html. If the doc distribution is
     installed on this machine, you will also find the formatted FAQ
     and Handbook documents in /usr/share/doc/

 3.  If you still have a question or problem, collect the output of
     `uname -a' along with error messages from whatever part of the
     system you are having problems with and email it as a question
     to the questions@FreeBSD.org mailing list.

If you are not familiar with FreeBSD's directory layout, please refer
to the hier(7) man page. If you are not familiar with man pages, type
"man man".
 
You may also use `/stand/sysinstall' to re-enter the installation and
configuration  utility.  Edit /etc/motd to change this login announcement.
