# - figure out our IP by querying the interface
# - fill /conf/etc (writable) with files from /etc, and then update

#   the IP of the subnet, "default", or nothing.
# - mount /conf/etc over /etc so we can see the new files.

# WARNING: i thing you should not change /etc/rc or strange things could

# Typically rc.conf and fstab need to be changed, but possibly
