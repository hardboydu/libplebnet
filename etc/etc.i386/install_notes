FreeBSD 1.0
INSTALLATION NOTES <1.00, 8 September 1993>

These notes have been prepared from those written originally for NetBSD
0.9. The conversion was done by someone who has had experience with
installing and upgrading 386bsd, but who is not a unix guru, so there
will be slant towards this experience. Corrections/updates are
welcomed, it is difficult/impossible to test every last hardware
combination.

Be sure to read _ALL_ of this document before you try to install
FreeBSD.  FreeBSD probably looks a bit similar to things that you've
seen before (perhaps 386BSD), but the installation procedures are quite
different.


FreeBSD 1.0 Release Contents:
------- --- ------- --------

The FreeBSD 1.0 Release consists of the following elements:

Bootable Kernel-copy floppies

	These disks contain file systems, are bootable, and
	have enough utilities on board to copy a new kernel
	to your hard disk once you have it partitioned
	for FreeBSD.  They make upgrading to a new kernel
	easy, because all you have to do is get a new
	kernel-copy floppy with a new kernel, boot from it,
	and confirm that you want to have the kernel copied
	to your disk.

	There are currently two different kernel copy floppy
	images, "kcopy-ah-floppy", and "kcopy-bt-floppy". The
        first has the driver for the Adaptec 154x and 1742 host
        adapter, the second has the drivers for the Bustek 742
        and Ultrastore host adapter.  Either floppy can be used
	for systems with MFM/RLL/IDE disk drives.

Installation floppies

	These are currently two disks which contain the
	software necessary to prepare your hard drive
	for FreeBSD and install the FreeBSD distribution.
	They are not bootable and must be used in
	conjunction with one of the kernel-copy floppies.
	These floppies are named "filesystem-floppy" and
        "cpio-floppy".

Upgrade floppies

        There is work being done on upgrading from 386bsd to
        FreeBSD. Presumably an announcement will be made on
        one of the comp.os.386bsd newsgroups in due course.
        This document ignores the existence of such floppies.

FreeBSD distribution sets

	These are collections of software, and include
	both the binaries necessary to run the system
	and the sources to the entire system.

	FreeBSD 1.0 is split up into three different
	distribution sets, one of which contains FreeBSD
	binaries, one of which contains the FreeBSD source,
	and the last of which contains the tools which
	are needed for a ``secure'' system.  This last set
	replaces certain binaries in the base binary distribution
	with binaries that contain the DES crypt(3) code.

	The binary distribution set can be found in
	the "binarydist" subdirectory of the distribution,
	and is named bin.tar.gz.aa to bin.tar.gz.db (ie 80
        files all told), plus file CKSUMS.

	The source distribution sets can be found in
	under "sourcedist" subdirectory of the distribution,
        and is named src.tar.gz.aa to src.tar.gz.cp (ie 68
        files all told), plus file CKSUMS.
	
	Finally, the security distribution set contains
	usr/src/libcrypt/*, the source files for the DES encryption
	algorithm, and the binaries which depend on it.
	It can be found in the "securedist" subdirectory on
        sites which choose to carry the complete FreeBSD
        distribution.  The GAMMA release included more binaries in
	this distribution than actually contain DES, this was an
	error and will be corrected for the next release.

	All of the files except the last files for each set
	are 240,640 bytes long.  (The last file is just long
	enough to contain the rest of the data for that
	distribution set.)

	Put together, the files for a set comprise a
	gzipped tar file.  If you don't want to
	go through the install process, but want to
	look at the contents of the files, you could use
	the command, say for the binarydist files,

		cat bin* | gunzip | tar tvf - | more

	or to extract the files themselves use

		cat bin* | gunzip | tar xvfp -

	Using this method, the files are extracted,
	"below" the current directory.  That is, if you
	want to extract the binaries "into" your system,
	i.e. replace the system binaries with them, you have
	to run the "tar xvfp" from /.

	In each of the distribution directories, there is
	a file named "CKSUMS" which contains the checksums
	of the files in that directory, as generated
	by the cksum(1) command.  You can use cksum to
	check the integrity of the archives, if you suspect
	one of the files is corrupt and have access to a
	cksum binary.  Note that the CKSUMS files are produced
	using the BSD 4.4 version of cksum which is POSIX
	compliant.  The values in this file will probably not
	match with cksums from other systems.  FreeBSD uses the
	new BSD 4.4 cksum routine.  A copy of the new cksum
	binary that will run on 386bsd/Netbsd/FreeBSD can be
	found in the "tools" subdirectory of the distribution.

	
System Requirements and Supported Devices:
------ ------------ --- --------- -------

FreeBSD 1.0 runs on ISA (AT-Bus) and EISA systems, with 386 and 486
processors, with or without math coprocessors.  It does NOT support
Micro-channel systems, such as some IBM PS/2 systems.  The minimal
configuration includes 4Meg of RAM, and a 60Meg hard disk, but to
install the entire system you'll need much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system more RAM is recommended.  (4Meg will actually
allow you to run X and/or compile, but it's extremely slow.)

Supported devices include:

	Standard floppy controllers
	Standard hard disk controllers:
		MFM
		ESDI
		IDE
		RLL
	SCSI hard disk controllers:
		Adaptec AHA-1542{A,B,C}, -1742		[kcopy-ah-floppy]
		Bustek 742 (EISA) Ultrastor 14f and 34f [kcopy-bt-floppy]
	Display Adaptors:
		MDA
		CGA
		VGA (and SVGA)
		HGC
	Serial communications ports
		8250
		16450
		16550A
	Ethernet controllers
		SMC/WD 8003, 8013, and equivalents
			(including the SMC "Elite" series)
		Novell NE1000, NE2000
		3COM 3c503
		ISOLAN ISOLink
	Tape drives:
		QIC-02 format tape drives
		most SCSI tape drives should work
		_NO_ QIC-40 or QIC-80 tape drives will work
	CD-ROM drives:
		most SCSI CD-ROM drives should work
		_NO_ non-SCSI CD-ROM drives will work

To be detected by the distributed kernels, the devices must
be configured as follows: (Note: IRQ 9 is the same as IRQ 2
on ISA/EISA based machines)

Getting the System on to Useful Media:
------- --- ------ -- -- ------ -----

Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	MS-DOS floppies
	Tape
	NFS partitions
	FTP

No matter what you do, however, you'll need to have three disks (1.2M
or 1.44M) handy, on which you will put the kernel-copy image and the
install (or upgrade) floppy images.

The images are available from the directory "floppies", under the root
of the FreeBSD/FreeBSD-1.0-GAMMA tree at your favorite archive site.
They're available both as raw disk images, and gzipped, to save time
downloading.

If you are using an AHA-154x or AHA-1742 SCSI host adapter, you need
the kcopy-ah-floppy image.  If you're using a BT-742 SCSI host adapter
or an Ultrastor adaptor, then you'll need the kcopy-bt-floppy image.
If you're using MFM/RLL/IDE disk controllers, you can use either
kernel-copy floppy image.

If you are using UNIX to make the floppies, you should use the command
dd(1) to write the raw floppy images (ie kcopy-ah-floppy or
kcopy-bt-floppy, filesystem-floppy and cpio-floppy) to the floppies. Use
"man dd" or ask your system administrator for details on the correct
set of arguments to use; it will be slightly different from system to
system, and the exact set of necessary arguments to dd is beyond the
scope of this document.

If you are using DOS to make the floppies, you should use the rawrite
utility.  This can be found in the "tools" subdirectory of the distribution.
It will write a raw image file to a disk, and the operation instructions
are self-evident.  Such files are 1228800 bytes in size.  You can rawrite
the images to either 1.2MB or 1.44MB floppies.

The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets for installation
depend on which method of installation you choose.  The various methods
are explained below.

To prepare for installing via MS-DOS floppies:
(NOTE: At this stage you can only prepare to install these files, you
cannot do the installation using "load_fd" as the mread program is not
on the installation disks, nor will the "load_fd" allow itself to be
terminated neatly and cleanly. No doubt this will be fixed in due
course, watch the newsgroups inside comp.os.386bsd.)  Work is already
in process to fix this.

	To prepare FreeBSD for installaton from MS-DOS floppies, you
	need to do the following:

		Count the number of "<set>.tar.gz.xx" files
		you have.  Call this number N.  You will
		need N/6 1.44M floppies, or N/5 1.2M
		floppies to install the distribution
		in this manner. For the set of bin files
		(ie 80 files) and 1.2 Mb floppies you will
		need 16 disks.

		Format all of the floppies, with MS-DOS.
		Don't make any of them MS-DOS bootable
		floppies.  (i.e. don't use "format /s"!)
		(If you use "format /u" then the format
		will run a tad faster).

		Place all of the "<set>.tar.gz.xx" files on
		the DOS disks.  (How you do this is up to
		you.  You could, for instance, use a DOS
		terminal program to download them on to
		the floppies, or perhaps use a UNIX machine
		capable of reading and writing DOS filesystems
		to place the files on the disk.  The
		possibilities are almost endless.) (If you are
		working off a 386bsd or related system, you can
		use "mwrite" to write the files to floppies -
		this is tedious but it does work. Use commands
		like this:-

			for i in aa ab ac ad ae; do
			mwrite bin.tar.gz.$i a:bintargz.$i; done

		Unfortunately, when/if you can retrieve these
		files back onto the new FreeBSD system, they 
		will have the wrong filenames and the filenames
		will be in upper case. How you fix this is
		currently "left as an exercise for the reader")

		(One suggestion is to use "tar" rather than "mwrite"
		when writing the floppies, and to modify the "load_fd"
		definition in the /.profile file to use "tar" rather
		than "mread" to get the files back).
			
	Once you have the files on DOS disks, you can proceed to the
	next step in the installation process, viz preparing your hard
	disk.

To prepare for installing via a tape:

	To install FreeBSD from a tape, you need to be somehow
	to get the FreeBSD filesets you wish to install on
	your system on to the appropriate kind of tape,
	in tar format.

	If you're making the tape on a UN*X system, the easiest
	way to do so is:

		tar cvf <tape_device> <files>

	where "<tape_device>" is the name of the tape device
	that describes the tape drive you're using (possibly
	something like /dev/nrst0, but we make no guarantees 8-).
	If you can't figure it out, ask your system administrator.
	"<files>" are the names of the "<set>.tar.gz.xx" files
	which you want to be placed on the tape.

To prepare for installing via an NFS partition:

	NOTE: this method of installation is recommended
	      only for those already familiar with using
	      the BSD network-manipulation commands and
	      interfaces.  If you aren't, this documentation
	      should help, but is not intended to be
	      all-encompassing.

	Place the FreeBSD software you wish to install into
	a directory on an NFS server, and make that directory
	mountable by the machine which you will be installing
	FreeBSD on.  This will probably require modifying the
	/etc/exports file of the NFS server and resetting
	mountd, acts which will require superuser privileges.
	Make a note of the numeric IP address of the NFS server
	and make a note of the router closest to the the new
	FreeBSD machine if the NFS server is not on a network
	which is directly attached to the FreeBSD machine.

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
	step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.

To prepare for installing via FTP:

	NOTE: this method of installation is recommended
	      only for those already familiar with using
	      the BSD network-manipulation commands and
	      interfaces.  If you aren't, this documentation
	      should help, but is not intended to be
	      all-encompassing.

	The preparations for this method of installation
	are easy: all you have to do is make sure that
	there's some FTP site from which you can retrieve
	the FreeBSD installation when it's time to do
	the install.  You should know the numeric IP
	address of that site, and the numeric IP address of
	your nearest router if the new FreeBSD computer is
	not on the same net or subnet as the FTP site.

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
	step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.

To upgrade:

	(This is still to be tested.)

Preparing your Hard Disk for FreeBSD Installation:
--------- ---- ---- ---- --- ------ ------------

NOTE: If you wish to install FreeBSD on your whole drive, (i.e. you do
not want DOS or any other operating system on your hard disk), you can
skip this section, and go on to "Installing the FreeBSD System."

Firstly, be sure you have a reliable backup of any data which you may
want to keep; repartitioning your hard drive is an excellent way to
destroy important data.

WARNING: If you are using a disk controller which supports disk
geometry translation, BE SURE TO USE THE SAME PARAMETERS FOR FreeBSD AS
FOR DOS!  If you do not, FreeBSD will not be able to properly coexist
with DOS.

Secondly, using the DOS "fdisk" program, repartition your hard drive to
create a new FreeBSD partition of at least 60 Mbyte in size.  Note the
starting location and size of this new partition; you will need this
information when you install FreeBSD.  Once you have created the new
partition, using a partition editor mark the new FreeBSD partition as
having a type of 0xA5.

Thirdly, using fdisk, set the other (ie non-FreeBSD) partition to be
"active", then, after leaving fdisk, do whatever is necessary to
restore order to that partition.  (If that partition used to contain
DOS, this will probably involve invoking the DOS "format" command,
probably in the manner of "format c:/s".  You will then have to restore
your backed-up data to the partition.)

You are now set to install FreeBSD on your hard drive.


Installing the FreeBSD System:
---------- --- ------ ------

Installing FreeBSD is a relatively complex process, but, if you have
this document in hand and are careful to read and remember the
information which is presented to you by the install program, it
shouldn't be too much trouble.

Before you begin, you must know several of your hard disk's
parameters.  You must know the number of sectors per track, the number
of tracks per cylinder (i.e. the number of heads), the number of bytes
per sector, and the number of cylinders on the disk.

If you are installing FreeBSD into a partition on your hard disk, you
should have completed the section regarding the preparation of your
hard disk, and you should know the size and offset from the beginning
of the disk of the FreeBSD partition.

(NOTE: The DOS fdisk counts in Megabytes or in percentage of disk
space, but the FreeBSD system counts in cylinders, so you need to
calculate carefully how many bytes there are to a cylinder, ie

	bytes/sector * heads(=trks/cyl) * (sectors/trk)

You are advised to align the FreeBSD partition on a cylinder boundary
and to round down the megabyte size of DOS)

Once you know the above information then you should be ready to proceed
with the FreeBSD installation.  It is essential to have a pencil,
paper, and calculator handy.

That all being said, it's finally time to install the system!

The following is a walk-through of the steps necessary to get FreeBSD
installed on your hard disk.  If you wish to stop the installation, you
may hit Control-C at any prompt, but if you do, you'll have to begin
again from scratch.

	Insert the kcopy-ah-floppy or kcopy-bt-floppy (as
	appropriate) into the boot drive. Boot from it. It will
	take a while to load the kernel from the floppy, probably
	on the order of a minute or two.  After it is loaded,
	it will present the message:

	"Insert file system floppy"

	If you do not see this message after a reasonable period of
	time, reboot and try it again.  If it doesn't work, try
	disabling your CPU's internal and external caches, and then
	try to boot again. If you still don't see it, then you can't
	install FreeBSD on your hardware.  If you were able to
	install 386bsd, this is definitely a bug in our software;
	please report it!  Please include your system configuration,
	and any other relevant information in your bug report.

	Once you have reached that prompt, remove the kcopy-xx-floppy
	from the drive.  Make sure that the first installation
	disk (ie the filesystem-floppy) is writable, insert it into
	the disk drive, and hit any key.

	You will then be presented with a copyright notice and a list
	of the hardware that FreeBSD recognizes as being in your
	machine. It would be sensible to make a note of the disk
	values for cylinders, heads, sectors etc for later use.

	After a short while (approximately 30 to 60 seconds), you
	should see a welcome message and a prompt, asking if you
	wish to proceed with the installation.

	If you wish to proceed, enter "y" and then return.

	You will then be asked what type of disk drive you have.
	The valid options are listed on the screen (eg SCSI, ESDI).

	You will then be asked for a label name for your disk.
	This should be a short, one-word name for your disk,
	e.g. "cp3100-mine" for a Conner Peripherals "3100" disk.
	You needn't remember this name.

	Next, you will be prompted for the geometry information you
	were supposed to remember about your disk.  Enter it when the
	install program asks for it.

	When asked for the size of the FreeBSD portion of the disk,
	either input the number listed as the total size of your
	disk, or multiply the number of cylinders in the FreeBSD
	portion of your disk by the number of sectors per cylinder
	(also listed by the install program) and input the result.

	If you are not installing on the whole disk, you will be
	asked for the offset of the FreeBSD partition from the
	beginning of the disk.  Again, calculate this number from
	the information you recorded when partitioning your disk
	with fdisk, and input the result.

	You will then be asked for the size of your root partition,
	in cylinders. The suggested maximum size is 15 Mbytes - so 
	you must divide 15,000,000 by the number that you get by
	calculating 

		(bytes/sector)*(sectors/trk)*(trks/cyl)

	Next, you will be asked for the size of your swap partition
	- again, you must calculate this in cylinders.  You should
	probably allocate around twice as much swap space as you
	have real memory.  If you wish the system to save crash dumps
	when it panics, you will need at least as much swap as you
	have RAM.

	The install program will then ask you for information about
	the rest of the partitions you want on your disk.  For the
	purposes of this document, you only want one more: /usr.
	Therefore, at the prompt, when in asks you to enter the size
	of the next partition, enter the number of cylinders remaining
	in the FreeBSD portion of the disk. When it asks you for the
	mount point for this partition, say "/usr".

	YOU ARE NOW AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN.

	If you confirm that you want to install FreeBSD, your hard
	drive will be modified, and perhaps it contents scrambled at
	the whim of the install program.  This is especially likely
	if you gave the install program incorrect information.

	If you are sure you want to proceed, enter "yes" at the prompt.

	The install program will now make the filesystems you
	specified.  There should be no errors in this section of the
	installation.  If there are, restart from the the beginning
	of the installation process.

	After the installation program prompts you to see if you'd
	like to be told about all of the files it's going to copy
	to your hard drive, it will spend a few minutes copying these
	files and then will print out an informative message and
	place you at a "#" prompt.

	Read the message and note which partition (eg sd0a or wd0a)
	you need to copy a kernel to.  Reboot the machine off the
	kcopy-xx-floppy disk, but this time at the prompt asking
	you to insert a file system floppy, do _not_ replace the
	floppy, just press <enter>.

	At the "kc>" prompt, enter "copy" to prepare to copy the
	kernel on the floppy to your hard disk.

	At the next "kc>" prompt, enter the disk partition to which
	you want to copy the kernel. (eg sd0a or wd0a).

	It will work for a minute or two, then present you with
	another "#" prompt.  Follow the instructions given, (ie
	halt the system) and reboot from the hard disk. You will
	probably have to do a hardware reset or else your ethernet
	card might not be recognised at reboot (eg if you have a
	WD8003EP card).

	When the machine boots, a three-line banner should appear at
	the top of the screen.  In a few seconds, a series of
	messages will appear, describing the hardware in your machine.
	Once again, this stage can take up to two minutes, so DO NOT
	PANIC!

	You will be asked to insert the cpio-floppy into a floppy
	drive, and enter that drive's number.  "0" corresponds to
	DOS's "A:" drive, "1" corresponds to DOS's "B:" drive.

	After you enter the number it will ask you if you'd like to
	watch its progress, and after you answer this question it
	will begin installing still more files on your hard disk.
	This should take no more than 3 minutes.

	You will be given (more) instructions, (eg to halt the
	system) and you should reboot the machine again, from the
	hard drive and probably with a hardware reset to kick your
	ethernet card back into life.

	CONGRATULATIONS: You now have the minimum base of FreeBSD
	files on your hard disk!  Now you get to install the
	distribution file sets.  Remember that, at minimum, you must
	install the bin.tar.gz.xx file set (see below for
	instructions).

	After the machine is done booting, you will be presented
	with a screenful of information about what to do next.

	What you do from this point on depends on which media you're
	using to install FreeBSD.  Follow the appropriate
	instructions, given below.

	To install from tape or floppy:

		The first thing you should do is to choose a temporary
		directory where the distribution files can be stored.
		To do this, use the command "set_tmp_dir" and enter
		your choice.  The default is /usr/distrib.

		After you have chosen a temporary directory,
		you should issue the appropriate load command:

			load_fd if you're loading from floppies
			(NOTE: as of time of writing these notes,
			this does not work).
			
			load_qic_tape if loading from QIC-02 tape

			load_scsi_tape if you're loading from the first
				       SCSI tape drive in the system.

		You will then be prompted for information as to which
		floppy drive to load from, if you choose that
		method of installation.

		Next, you will be told to insert the media into
		the appropriate drive, and hit return.  Continue
		to follow instructions until you are returned to
		the "#" prompt.

		Go to the directory which contains the first
		distribution set you wish to install.  This is
		either the directory you specified above, if loading
		from floppy, or possibly a subdirectory of that
		directory, if you loaded from tape.

		When there, run "set_tmp_dir" again, and choose
		the default temporary directory, by hitting
		return at the prompt.

		Run the "extract" command, giving it as its sole
		argument the name of the distribution set you
		wish to extract.  For example, to extract the binary
		distribution, use the command:

			extract bin

		and to extract the source distribution:

			extract src

		After the extraction is complete, go to the location
		of the next set you want to extract, "set_tmp_dir"
		again, and once again issue the appropriate
		extract command.  Continue this process until
		you've finished installing all of the sets which you
		desire to have on your hard disk.

		After each set is finished, if you know that you
		are running low on space you can remove the
		distribution files for that set by saying:

			rm <set>*

		For example, if you wish to remove the distribution
		files for the binarydist set, after the "extract bin"
		command has completed, issue the command:

			rm bin*

		Once you have extracted all sets and are at the "#" prompt
		again, proceed to the section "Configuring Your System,"
		below.

	To install via FTP or NFS:

		First you must decide on a temporary directory to hold
		the <set>.tar.gz.xx files. The directory /usr/distrib
		is suggested. You should cd to it, if necessary do
		a mkdir first. Use set_tmp_dir to identify this 
		directory to the install process.

		Configure the appropriate ethernet interface (e.g. ed0,
		ne0, etc.) up, with a command like:

			ifconfig <ifname> <ipaddr> [netmask <netmask>]

		where <ifname> is the interface name (e.g. ed0, etc.),
		and <ipaddr> is the numeric IP address of the interface.
		If the interface has a special netmask, supply
		the word "netmask" and that netmask at the end of the
		command line.  For instance, without a special netmask:

			ifconfig ed0 129.133.10.10

		or with a special netmask

			ifconfig ed0 128.32.240.167 netmask 0xffffff00

		or the equivalent

			ifconfig ed0 128.32.240.167 netmask 255.255.255.0

		If you are using the AUI connector on a 3C503 card, you
		must also set the LLC0 flag (the default is to use the BNC
		connector):

			ifconfig ed0 130.252.23.86 llc0

		If the NFS server or FTP server is not on a directly-
		connected network, you should set up a route to it
		with the command:

			route add default <gate_ipaddr>

		where <gate_ipaddr> is your gateway's numeric IP address.

		If you are NFS-mounting the distribution sets,
		mount them on the temporary directory with the command:

			mount -t nfs <serv_ipaddr>:<dist_dir> <tmp_dir>

		where <serv_ipaddr> is the server's numeric IP address,
		<dist_dir> is the path to the distribution files on
		the server, and <tmp_dir> is the name of the local
		temporary directory (eg /usr/distrib). Proceed as if
		you had loaded the
		files from tape, "cd"ing to the appropriate directories
		and running "set_tmp_dir" and "extract" as appropriate.

		If you are retrieving the distribution sets using ftp,
		cd into the temp directory, and execute the command:

			ftp <serv_ipaddr>

		where <serv_ipaddr> is the server's
		numeric IP address.  Get the files with FTP,
		taking care to use binary mode to transfer
		all files. A simple set of commands is

			ftp <serv_ipaddr>
			cd <where/the/binarydist/files/are>
			hash
			binary
			mget *
			quit

		Once you have all of the files for the distribution sets
		that you wish to install, you can proceed using the
		instructions above as if you had installed the files
		from a floppy.

	You might wish to install the binarydist first, get that
	working, and then at a later point in time have a go at
	installing the sourcedist. BEFORE YOU REBOOT AFTER INSTALLING
	THE BINARYDIS, you must preserve the commands that do the
	extracting. They are kept in the single-user-mode .profile
	file called /.profile.  Proceed like this:-

		mv /.profile /.profile.install
		ln /root/.profile /.profile

	When you are ready to install the sourcedist at some time
	in the future, get into multi-user mode (ie the normal
	means of running FreeBSD) and issue these commands:-

		cp /.profile.install /.profile
		shutdown now

	This will cause the system to go into single-user mode, and
	the install profile will be active (ie you will find the
	commands load_fd, extract etc available to you again).


Configuring Your System:
----------- ---- ------

Once you have finished extracting all of the distribution sets that you
want on your hard drive and are back at the "#" prompt, you are ready
to configure your system.

The configuration utility expects that you have installed the base
system.  If you have not, you will not be able to run it successfully
(nor will you have a functional system regardless of configuration).

To configure the newly installed operating system, run the command
"configure".

Configure will ask for the machine's hostname, domain name, and other
network configuration information.

Once you have supplied configure all that it requests, your machine
will be configured well enough that when you reboot it it will be a
completely functional FreeBSD system.  It is not completely configured,
however; you should adjust the /etc/sendmail.cf file as necessary to
suit your site and/or disable sendmail in /etc/rc and you should look
in /etc/netstart to make sure the flags are defined correctly for your
site. You might wish to set up several other tcp/ip files, such as

	/etc/resolv.conf
	/etc/networks

Once you are done with configuration, reboot with the "reboot" command.

When it boots off of the hard drive, you will have a complete FreeBSD
system!  CONGRATULATIONS! (You really deserve them!!!)
