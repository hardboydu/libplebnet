                INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR FreeBSD 1.0 GAMMA

Welcome to FreeBSD!  This document has been put together in an effort
to make initial installation of the system as easy as possible.

1.  To install FreeBSD you will need 4 floppies, as well as the bulk of
    the distribution on some other medium (floppy, tape, CD, etc).  If
    you've retrieved this release from the net, you'll first have to make
    the floppies yourself using the supplied images.

    Due to the differences in PC configurations, we've found it necessary
    to provide multiple initial boot images that provide kernels for
    different types of systems.

    If your disk controller is one of:

	IDE/ST506
	Adaptec 1542{A,B,C}
	Adaptec 1742A

    Then please use the disk image:	kcopy-ah-floppy
    to construct your boot floppy.

    If your disk controller is one of:

	Bustek 742a
	UltraStore {14,34}F

    Then please use the disk image:	kcopy-bt-floppy
    to construct your boot floppy.

    Next, make a second floppy from the disk image:	filesystem-floppy
    You'll need this for the second stage of the boot process.

    Next, make a third floppy from the disk image:	cpio-floppy
    You'll need this for the last stage of the boot process.

    Finally, make a fourth floppy from the disk image:	dos-floppy
    You'll need this for the last stage of the boot process.
    This disk is MS-DOS readable and contains the os-bs boot manager
    (for use if you are installing more than one operating system on disk.)

2.  Boot the first floppy.  When it asks you to insert the file system,
    insert your second ``filesystem-floppy.''  Follow the instructions
    that floppy gives you.  If partitions  already exist on the hard disk,
    then by default, FreeBSD attempts to install at the end of these.
    Before rebooting, note the type of disk it says to copy the kernel
    to, ``sd0a'' or ``wd0a'' (``sd0a'' is for SCSI systems, ``wd0a'' is
    for all others.)  When the system halts, go on to the next step.

3.  Boot the first floppy again, but this time when it asks
    you to insert the file system floppy, just press the return key.
    Follow the instructions that the floppy gives you.  When you see
    the ``kc>'' prompt, type ``copy'' (without quotes).  At the next prompt,
    ``copy kernel to>'', type either ``sd0a'' or ``wd0a'' as given in
    the previous step.  When the system halts, go on to the next step.

4.  Making sure that there's no floppy in the drive, press return to boot
    from the hard disk.  After it has booted and is asking what drive the
    cpio floppy is in, insert the third floppy (cpio-floppy) into a
    floppy drive and answer the question about what drive it is in.
    Note that 0 is the same as DOS drive A:, and 1 is the same as DOS
    drive B:

5.  After the cpio-floppy has been copied to the disk, remove it from the
    drive and insert the fourth floppy (dos-floppy).  Again, specify the 
    drive to read from.

5.  After the dos-floppy has been copied to the disk, enter `halt' at
    the command prompt.

6.  When the system asks you to press the return key to reboot, first
    remove the floppy and then press the return key to boot from the hard
    disk.

7.  At this point you will get 4 errors from the fsck on boot, these
    are normal and are caused by files that were open when the
    /dev entries were built - just ignore them.  The system will
    correct these errors and then halt, after which you should press
    the return key again to reboot with a clean system.

8.  Congratulations, you've got the mini FreeBSD system on your disk!

9.  Follow the instructions about set_tmp_dir and extract that
    will come on your screen after you've pressed the return key.

10. You will get the following errors while extracting the bin
    distribution, you can safely ignore them.

	/tmp/tar: Could not create file bin/sh : Text file busy
	/tmp/tar: Could not create file sbin/init : Text file busy
	/tmp/tar: Could not link .profile to root/.profile : File exists

11. Run the configure command to set up some of the /etc files by
    typing ``configure''.  You will have to edit /etc/netstart after
    this if you have a networking interface.

12. Reboot so that the system comes up multiuser by typing ``reboot''.

13. You are now running FreeBSD!  Congradulations!  You may now continue
    with installing the source distribution, or stop here for now.

    Should you decided to postpone further installation, you should
    probably save the ``installing profile'' for possible future use by
    saving it and linking a default profile into place.

    Do it like this:

	mv /.profile /.profile.install
	ln /root/.profile /.profile

14. If your system has several operating systems, you may want to install
    the Thomas Wolfram's os-bs boot manager for selecting which system to
    boot.  This works well with DOS, OS/2, FreeBSD and other systems.  To
    install it, boot the system with MS-DOS and insert the dos-floppy of
    the FreeBSD install suite in floppy drive A:.  Then enter the DOS
    commands:
    > A:
    > os-bs135
    > cd os-bs
    > os-bs
    Use the cursor keys to highlight the install option and hit
    ENTER.  The readme.1st file in the os-bs directory contains
    more information about os-bs.

    If you choose not to install os-bs, then fdisk can be used to change
    the boot system.  This is done by setting the primary partition for
    that system active.  FreeBSD has an fdisk command that can be used
    for this purpose as well.

15. In addition to the FreeBSD  source and binary distributions, many 
    additional packages, such as X11 and TeX, may be obtained from 
    freebsd.cdrom.com - please have a look around!  You may also find 
    this a good time to read the release notes in /usr/src/RELNOTES.FreeBSD.
