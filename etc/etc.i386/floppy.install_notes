                INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR FreeBSD 1.0 GAMMA

Welcome to FreeBSD!  This document has been put together in an effort
to make initial installation of the system as easy as possible.

1.  To install FreeBSD you will need 3 floppies, as well as the bulk of
    the distribution on some other medium (floppy, tape, CD, etc).  If
    you've retrieved this release from the net, you'll first have to make
    the floppies yourself using the supplied images.

    Due to the differences in PC configurations, we've found it necessary
    to provide multiple initial boot images that provide kernels for
    different types of systems.

    If your disk controller is one of:

	IDE/ST506
	Adaptec 1542{A,B,C}
	Adaptec 1742A

    Then please use the disk image:	kcopy-ah-floppy
    to construct your boot floppy.

    If your disk controller is one of:

	Bustek 742a
	UltraStore {14,34}F

    Then please use the disk image:	kcopy-bt-floppy
    to construct your boot floppy.

    Next, make a second floppy from the disk image:	filesystem-floppy
    You'll need this for the second stage of the boot process.

    Finally, make a third floppy from the disk image:	cpio-floppy
    You'll need this for the last stage of the boot process.

2.  Boot the first floppy.  When it asks you to insert the file system,
    insert your second ``filesystem-floppy.''  Follow the instructions
    that floppy gives you, making note of the type of disk it says to
    copy the kernel to, ``sd0a'' or ``wd0a'' (``sd0a'' is for SCSI systems,
    ``wd0a'' is for all others.) When the system halts, go on to the next
    step.

3.  Boot the first floppy again, but this time when it asks
    you to insert the file system floppy, just press the return key.
    Follow the instructions that the floppy gives you.  When you see
    the ``kc>'' prompt, type ``copy'' (without quotes).  At the next prompt,
    ``copy kernel to>'', type either ``sd0a'' or ``wd0a'' as given in
    the previous step.  When the system halts, go on to the next step.

4.  Making sure that there's no floppy in the drive, press return to boot
    from the hard disk.  After it has booted and is asking what drive the
    cpio floppy is in, insert the third floppy (cpio-floppy) into a
    floppy drive and answer the question about what drive it is in.
    Note that 0 is the same as DOS drive A:, and 1 is the same as DOS
    drive B:

5.  After the cpio-floppy has been copied to the disk, enter ``halt''.

6.  When the system asks you to press the return key to reboot, first
    remove the floppy and then press the return key to boot from the hard
    disk.

7.  At this point you will get 4 errors from the fsck on boot, this
    is normal and is caused by files that were open when the
    /dev entries were built - just ignore them.  The system will
    correct these errors and then halt, after which you should press
    the return key again to reboot with a clean system.

8.  Congratulations, you've got the mini FreeBSD system on the disk!

9.  Follow the instructions about set_tmp_dir and extract that
    will come on your screen after you've pressed the return key.

10. You will get the following errors while extracting the bin
    distribution, you can safely ignore them.

	/tmp/tar: Could not create file bin/sh : Text file busy
	/tmp/tar: Could not create file sbin/init : Text file busy
	/tmp/tar: Could not link .profile to root/.profile : File exists

11. Run the configure command to set up some of the /etc files by
    typing ``configure''.  You will have to edit /etc/netstart after
    this if you have a networking interface.

12. Reboot so that the system comes up multiuser by typing ``reboot''.

13. You are now running FreeBSD!  Congradulations!  You may now continue
    with installing the source distribution, or stop here for now.

    Should you decided to postpone further installation, you should
    probably save the ``installing profile'' for possible future use by
    saving it and linking a default profile into place.

    Do it like this:

	mv /.profile /.profile.install
	ln /root/.profile /.profile

14. In addition to the source and binary distributions, many additional
    packages, such as X11 and TeX, may be obtained from freebsd.cdrom.com -
    please have a look around!  You may also find this a good time to
    read the release notes in /usr/src/RELNOTES.FreeBSD.
