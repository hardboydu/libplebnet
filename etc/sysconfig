# Set to a string representing the interrupts you are going to use
#  for generating entropy in the kernel (or NO to ignore).
#  If the machine is networked, the Ethernet card IRQ is good.
#  The IRQ on an intelligent hard disk controller is good.
#  The IRQ's on most sound devices are good.
#
#  The following choices are BAD:
#  The IRQ's on COM-ports (SIO devices), the IRQ used by a "classic"
#  IDE disk or cdrom (Intelligent controllers seem to be OK), and
#  the IRQ on the system clock.
#
# Experiment with the rest. The best interrupts are the ones that
#  happen fairly irregularly, and never occur in very high-speed bursts.
#
# You'll have it right when you have a good supply of numbers from
#  /dev/random, and no problems on your system, like slowdowns,
#  Sluggish net/disk activity, perhaps even errors.

# For example - if you have a sound blaster on IRQ5, an ethernet card
# on IRQ10 and a SCSI controller on IRQ11 (eg ADAPTEC 1542) you might
# try this:
#
#	rand_irqs="-s 5 -s 10 -s 11"
