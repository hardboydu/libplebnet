# This enables a simple local "raw" printer, hooked up to the first
# parallel port.  No kind of filtering is done, so everything you
# pass to the "lpr" command will be printed unmodified.
#
# Remember, for further print queues you're going to add, you have to
# chose different spool directories (the "sd" capability below),
# otherwise you will greatly confuse lpd.
#
# For some advanced printing, have a look at the "apsfilter" package.
# It plugs into the lpd system, allowing you to print a variety of
# different file types by converting everything to PostScript(tm)
# format.  If you don't have a PostScript(tm) printer, don't panic,
# but do also install the "ghostscript" package.
#
# Do also refer to section 7 (Printing) of the handbook.  A local copy
# can be found under /usr/share/doc/handbook/handbook.{html,latin1}.
#
# Banner pages are now suppressed by default.  Remove the :sh:
# capability to turn them back on.

# Sample remote printer.  The physical printer is on machine "lphost".
# NB: you cannot perform any kind of local filtering directly.  If
# you need local filters (e.g. LF -> CR-LF conversion for HP printers),
# create a filter script that recursively calls lpd with another -P
# argument after filtering.
