# /etc/rc.diskless - general BOOTP startup
#
#	BOOTP has mounted / for us.  Assume a read-only mount.  We must then
#	- figure out where the NFS mount is coming from
#	- figure out our IP by querying the interface
#	- retarget /conf/ME softlink to proper configuration script directory
#
#	It is expected that /etc/fstab and /etc/rc.conf.local will be
#	set by the system operator on the server to be softlinks to
#	/conf/ME/fstab and /conf/ME/rc.conf.local.  The system operator may
#	choose to retarget other files as well.  The server itself boots
#	properly with its default /conf/ME softlink pointing to 
#	/conf/server.host.name.  
#
#	During a diskless boot, we retarget the /conf/ME softlink to point
#	to /conf/DISKLESS.CLIENT.IP.ADDRESS.  Thus, various system config
#	files that are softlinks through /conf/ME also get retargeted.
