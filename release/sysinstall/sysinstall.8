.Sh NAME
.Nm sysinstall
.Nd system installation and configuration tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar var=value
.Op Ar function
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility for installing and configuring
.Fx
systems.
It is the first utility invoked by the
.Fx
installation boot
floppy and is also copied into
.Pa /stand/sysinstall
on newly installed
.Fx
systems for use in later configuring the system.
.Pp
The
.Nm
program is generally invoked without arguments for the default
behavior, where the main installation/configuration menu is presented.

On those occasions where it is deemed necessary to invoke a subsystem
of sysinstall directly, however, it is also possible to do so by
naming the appropriate function entry points on the command line.
Since this action is essentially identical to running an installation
script, each command-line argument corresponding to a line of script,
the reader is encouraged to read the section on scripting for more
information on this feature.
.Pp
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
is essentially nothing more than a monolithic C program with
the ability to write MBRs and disk labels (through the services
of the
.Xr libdisk 3
library) and install distributions or packages onto new and
existing
.Fx
systems.  It also contains some extra intelligence
for running as a replacement for
.Xr init 8
when it's invoked by the
.Fx
installation boot procedure.  It
assumes very little in the way of additional utility support and
performs most file system operations by calling the relevant syscalls
(such as
.Xr mount 2 )
directly.
.Pp
.Nm
currently uses the
.Xr dialog 3
library to do user interaction with simple ANSI line graphics, color
support for which is enabled by either running on a syscons VTY or some
other color-capable terminal emulator (newer versions of xterm will support
color when using the
.Dq xterm-color
termcap entry).
.Pp
This product is currently at the end of its life cycle and will
eventually be replaced.
.Sh RUNNING SCRIPTS
.Nm
may be either driven interactively through its various internal menus
or run in batch mode, driven by an external script.  Such a script may
be loaded and executed in one of 3 ways:

.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Sy "LOAD_CONFIG_FILE"
If
.Nm
is compiled with LOAD_CONFIG_FILE set in the environment
(or in the Makefile) to some value, then that value will
be used as the filename to automatically look for and load
when
.Nm
starts up and with no user interaction required.
This option is aimed primarily at large sites who wish to create a
single prototype install for multiple machines with largely identical
configurations and/or installation options.

.It Sy "MAIN MENU"
If
.Nm
is run interactively, that is to say in the default manner, it will
bring up a main menu which contains a "load config file" option.
Selecting this option will prompt for the name of a script file which
it then will attempt to load from a DOS or UFS formatted floppy.

.It Sy "COMMAND LINE"
Each command line argument is treated as a script directive
when
.Nm
is run in multi-user mode.  Execution ends either by explicit request
(e.g. calling the
.Ar shutdown
directive), upon reaching the end of the argument list or on error.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal
/stand/sysinstall _ftpPath=ftp://ziggy/pub/ mediaSetFTP configPackages
.Ed
.Pp
Would initialize
.Nm
for FTP installation media (using the server `ziggy') and then
bring up the package installation editor, exiting when finished.
.El
.Pp
.Sh SCRIPT SYNTAX
A script is a list of one or more directives, each directive taking
the form of:

.Ar var=value
.Pp
.Ar function
.Pp
or
.Ar #somecomment

Where
.Ar var=value
is the assignment of some internal
.Nm
variable, e.g. "ftpPass=FuNkYChiKn", and
.Ar function
is the name of an internal
.Nm
function, e.g. "mediaSetFTP", and
.Ar #comment
is a single-line comment for documentation purposes (ignored by
sysinstall).  Each directive must be by itself on a single line,
functions taking their arguments by examining known variable names.
This requires that you be sure to assign the relevant variables before
calling a function which requires them.  When and where a function
depends on the settings of one or more variables will be noted in the
following table:

.Pp
\fBFunction Glossary:\fR
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It configAnonFTP
Invoke the Anonymous FTP configuration menu.
.Pp
\fBVariables:\fR None
.It configRouter
Select which routing daemon you wish to use, potentially
loading any required 3rd-party routing daemons as necessary.
.Pp
\fBVariables:\fR
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It router
can be set to the name of the desired routing daemon,
e.g.
.Dq routed
or
.Dq gated ,
otherwise it is prompted for.

.Pp
\fBVariables:\fR None
.It configXEnvironment

.Pp
\fBVariables:\fR None
.It diskPartitionEditor
Invokes the disk partition (MBR) editor.
.Pp
\fBVariables:\fR
.Bl -tag -width findx
.It geometry
The disk geometry, as a cyls/heads/sectors formatted string.  Default: no
change to geometry.
.It partition
Set to disk partitioning type or size, its value being
.Ar free
in order to use only remaining free space for
.Fx ,
.Ar all
to use the entire disk for
.Fx
but maintain a proper partition
table,
.Ar existing
to use an existing
.Fx
partition (first found),
.Ar exclusive
to use the disk in
.Dq dangerously dedicated
mode or, finally,
.Ar somenumber
to allocate
.Ar somenumber
blocks of available free space to a new
.Fx
partition.
Default:  Interactive mode.
.It bootManager
is set to one of
.Ar boot
to signify the installation of a boot manager,
.Ar standard
to signify installation of a "standard" non-boot MGR DOS
MBR or
.Ar none
to indicate that no change to the boot manager is desired.
Default: none.
.El
.Pp
Note: Nothing is actually written to disk by this function, a explicit call to
.Ar diskPartitionWrite
being required for that to happen.
.It diskPartitionWrite
Causes any pending MBR changes (typically from the
.Ar diskPartitionEditor
function) to be written out.
.Pp
\fBVariables:\fR None
.It diskLabelEditor
Invokes the disk label editor.  This is a bit trickier from a script
since you need to essentially label everything inside each
.Fx
(type 0xA5) partition created by the
.Ar diskPartitionEditor
function, and that requires knowing a few rules about how things are
laid out.  When creating a script to automatically allocate disk space
and partition it up, it is suggested that you first perform the
installation interactively at least once and take careful notes as to
what the slice names will be, then and only then hardwiring them into
the script.
.Pp
For example, let's say you have a SCSI disk on which you've created a new
.Fx
partition in slice 2 (your DOS partition residing in slice 1).
The slice name would be
.Ar da0s2
for the whole
.Fx
partition
.Ar ( da0s1
being your DOS primary
partition).  Now let's further assume that you have 500MB in this
partition and you want to sub-partition that space into root, swap,
var and usr file systems for
.Fx .
Your invocation of the
.Ar diskLabelEditor
function might involve setting the following variables:
.Bl -tag -width findx
.It Li "da0s2-1=ufs 40960 /"
A 20MB root file system (all sizes are in 512 byte blocks).
.It Li "da0s2-2=swap 131072 /"
A 64MB swap partition.
.It Li "da0s2-3=ufs 204800 /var"
A 100MB /var file system.
.It Li "da0s2-4=ufs 0 /usr"
With the balance of free space (around 316MB) going to the /usr
file system.
.El

One can also use the
.Ar diskLabelEditor
for mounting or erasing existing partitions as well as creating new
ones.  Using the previous example again, let's say that we also wanted
to mount our DOS partition and make sure that an
.Pa /etc/fstab
entry is created for it in the new installation.  Before calling the
.Ar diskLabelEditor
function, we simply add an additional line:
.Pp
.Dl "da0s1=/dos_c N"
.Pp
before the call.  This tells the label editor that you want to mount
the first slice on
.Pa /dos_c
and not to attempt to newfs it (not that
.Nm
would attempt this for a DOS partition in any case, but it could just
as easily be an existing UFS partition being named here and the 2nd
field is non-optional).
.Pp
Note:  No file system data is actually written to disk until an
explicit call to
.Ar diskLabelCommit
is made.
.It diskLabelCommit
Writes out all pending disklabel information and creates and/or mounts any
file systems which have requests pending from the
.Ar diskLabelEditor
function.
.Pp
\fBVariables:\fR None
.It distReset
Resets all selected distributions to the empty set (no distributions selected).
.Pp
\fBVariables:\fR None

Allows the selection of a custom distribution set (e.g. not just on of the
existing "canned" sets) with no user interaction.
