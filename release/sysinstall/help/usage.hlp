HOW TO USE THIS SYSTEM
======================

The following keys are recognised in most of the dialogs you'll
encounter during this installation:

KEY             ACTION
---             ------
SPACE           Select or toggle the current item.
RETURN          Continue or invoke selected menu button.
UP ARROW        Move to previous item (or up, in a text field).
DOWN ARROW      Move to next item (or down, in a text field).
TAB             Move to next item or group.
RIGHT ARROW     Move to next item or group (same as TAB).
SHIFT-TAB       Move to previous item or group.
LEFT ARROW      Move to previous item or group (same as SHIFT-TAB).
PAGE UP         In text boxes, scrolls up one page.
PAGE DOWN       In text boxes, scrolls down one page.

If you see small "^(-)" or "v(+)" symbols at the edges of a menu, it
means that there are more items above or below the current one that
aren't being shown (due to insufficient screen space).  Using the
up/down arrow keys will cause the menu to scroll.  The PageUp and
PageDown keys will scroll by entire screens.

In text fields, the amount of text above the current point will be
displayed as a percentage in the lower right corner.  A value of
100% means that you're at the bottom of the available text.

Selecting OK in a menu will confirm whatever action it's controlling.
Selecting Cancel will cancel the operation and generally return you to
the previous menu.


SPECIAL FEATURES:
=================

It is also possible to select a menu item by typing the first
character of its name, if unique.  Such "accelerator" characters will
be specially highlighted in the item name.  Unfortunately, the
accellerators aren't always unique (a shortcoming of the dialog menu
library) so you'll only be able to get at the *first* unique menu
entry for a given accellerator.

The console driver also contains a scroll-back buffer for reviewing
things that may have scrolled off the screen.  To use scroll-back,
press the "Scroll Lock" key on your keyboard and use the arrow or Page
Up/Page Down keys to move through the saved text.  To leave
scroll-back mode, press the Scroll Lock key again.  This feature is
most useful for reading back through your boot messages (go ahead, try
it now!) though it's also useful when dealing with sub-shells or other
"wizard modes" that don't use menus and tend to scroll their output
off the top of the screen.

Once the system is fully installed and running multi-user you will
also find that you have multiple "virtual consoles" and can use them
to have several active sessions at once.  Use ALT-F<n> to switch
between them, where `F<n>' is the function key corresponding to the
screen you wish to see.  By default, the system comes with 3 virtual
consoles enabled.  You can create more by editing the /etc/ttys file
(up to a maximum of 12).
