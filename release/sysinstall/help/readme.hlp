Please note that SNAPSHOT releases, as much        ______( (_  / \______/
as we enjoy seeing them tested in serious        ,'  ,-----'   |
situations, are NOT recommended for production   `--{__________)
environments!  They are first and foremost test
vehicles used by the project to periodically give testers or developers
access to the latest -current technology.  They are not put through the
same quality assurance mechanisms that full releases are!
