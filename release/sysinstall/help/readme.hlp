TARGET AUDIENCE:
----------------
This release is aimed primarily at early-adopters and the various
other folks who want to get on board with 3.0 and are willing to deal
with the various down-sides of a "dot-zero" release.  We have naturally
done our best to ensure that 3.0 performs as advertised but, as the
first release on a branch which has seen some very radical changes
from 2.2.x (SMP, ELF, new boot blocks, many kernel changes, etc), it's
also very new technology and will require at least one more release
along the 3.0 branch before it's ready for "production" purposes.
This is one of the reasons why the 2.2.x branch will be continuing
into November, with the scheduled release of 2.2.8, and possibly a bit
beyond.

If you're both technically proficient and know exactly what you're
getting into here (e.g. you've been following -current) then 3.0 is
probably for you.  If you're more interested in doing business with
FreeBSD than in playing with the cutting edge of technology, however,
then 2.2.x is almost certainly your best bet.
