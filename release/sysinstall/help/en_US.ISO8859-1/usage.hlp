HOW TO USE THIS SYSTEM
======================

KEY             ACTION
---             ------
UP ARROW        Move to previous item (or up, in a text field).
DOWN ARROW      Move to next item (or down, in a text field).
TAB             Move to next item or group.
RIGHT ARROW     Move to next item or group (same as TAB).
SHIFT-TAB       Move to previous item or group.
LEFT ARROW      Move to previous item or group (same as SHIFT-TAB).
RETURN          Select item.
ESC             Spawn a sub-shell for diagnostic purposes.  Exit returns.
PAGE UP         In text boxes, scrolls up one page.
PAGE DOWN       In text boxes, scrolls down one page.
SPACE		In "radio" or multiple choice menus, toggle the current item.
F1              Help (in screens that provide it).

If you also see small "^(-)" or "v(+)" symbols at the edges of a menu,
it means that there are more items above or below the current one that
aren't being shown (due to insufficient screen space).  Using the
up/down arrow keys will cause the menu to scroll.  When a symbol
disappears, it means you are at the top (or bottom) of the menu.

In text fields, the amount of text remaining will be displayed as a
percentage in the lower right corner.  100% means you're at the bottom
of the field.

Selecting OK in a menu will confirm whatever action it's controlling.
Selecting Cancel will cancel the operation and generally return you to
the previous menu.


SPECIAL FEATURES:
=================

It is also possible to select a menu item by typing the first
character of its name, if unique.  Such "accellerator" characters will
be specially highlighted in the item name.

The console driver also contains a scroll-back buffer for reviewing
things that may have scrolled off the screen.  To use scroll-back,
press the "Scroll Lock" key on your keyboard and use the arrow or
Page Up/Page Down keys to move through the saved text.  To leave
scroll-back mode, press the Scroll Lock key again.  This feature
is most useful for dealing with sub-shells or other "wizard modes"
that don't use menus.
