The following options may be set from this screen:

NFS Secure:		NFS server talks only on a secure port

	This is most commonly used when talking to Sun workstations, which
	will not talk NFS over "non priviledged" ports.


NFS Slow:		User is using a slow PC or ethernet card

	Use this option if you have a slow PC (386) or an ethernet card
	with poor performance being "fed" by NFS on a higher-performance
	workstation.  This will throttle the workstation back to prevent
	the PC from becoming swamped with data.


FTP Abort:		On transfer failure, abort

	This is pretty self-explanatory.  If you're transfering from a
	host that drops the connection or cannot provide a file, abort
	the installation of that piece.


FTP Reselect:	On transfer failure, ask for another host

	This is more useful to someone doing an interactive installation.
	If the current host stops working, ask for a new ftp server to
	resume the installation from.  The install will attempt to pick
	up from where it left off on the other server, if at all possible.


FTP Active:		Use "active mode" for standard FTP

	For all FTP transfers, use "Active" mode.  This will not work
	through firewalls, but will often work with older ftp servers
	that do not support passive mode.  If your connection hangs
	with passive mode (the default), try active!


FTP Passive:	Use "passive mode" for firewalled FTP

	For all FTP transfers, use "Passive" mode.  This allows the user
	to pass through firewalls that do not allow incoming connections
	on random port addresses.

NOTE: Active and passive modes are not the same as a `proxy'
connections where a proxy ftp server is listening on a different port.
In these situations, you should specify the URL as something like:

	ftp://foo.bar.com:1234/pub/FreeBSD

Where "1234" is the port number of the proxy ftp server.


Debugging:	Turn on the extra debugging flag

	This turns on a lot of extra noise over on the second screen
	(ALT-F2 to see it, ALT-F1 to switch back).  If your installation
	should fail for any reason, PLEASE turn this flag on when
	attempting to reproduce the problem.  It will provide a lot of
	extra debugging at the failure point and may be very helpful to
	the developers in tracking such problems down!


Yes To All:	Assume "Yes" answers to all non-critical dialogs

	This flag should be used with caution.  It will essentially
	decide NOT to ask the user about any "boundry" conditions that
	might not constitute actual errors but may be warnings indicative
	of other problems.



A number of these items, like "FTP Active" and "FTP Passive", are
actually mutually-exclusive even though you can turn them on all at
once or deselect them all; this is a limitation in the menuing system.

If you re-enter the Options menu, you'll see the settings it's
actually using after the system checked for any possible conflicts.
