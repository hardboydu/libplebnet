			Small replacement for netstat
			-----------------------------

This program implements some basic functionality subset of normal netstat -
it can display the routing table and protocol statistics.

Large part of the code dealing with retrieving the routing table via sysctl(3)
was taken from code examples written by Richard Stevens to accompany his
excellent book.

Usage
-----

	ns [-r] [-s [-p ip|tcp|udp|icmp]]

where

	-r	print routing table (default)
	-s	print protocol statistics
		Options:
		-p proto	display only statistics related to this
				protocol, where 'proto' is one of:
				- ip
				- tcp
				- udp
				- icmp

Bugs
----

* The link layer information is still missing.
* 'ns' doesn't resolve IP adresses to names
* well, real netstat provides _much_ more information... but this one needs
  to be small, right? :-)
