What is it?
-----------

This utility is taken almost in its entirety from /stand/sysinstall. It allows
to gather device configuration which possibly was changed in userconfig (-c)
session, and to save it to /kernel.config file on startup floppy, so that when
user boots next time, the settings will automatically be changed.

How can I use it?
-----------------

The best way is to call it from /etc/rc in such phase when the startup floppy
is mounted, and redirect its output to /kernel.config on the floppy.

NOTE: You need first to create symbols' list, using 'dumpnlist' utility, and
place it in /stand/symbols.

Usage is straightforward:

	kget -incore|kernel_name output_filename [vanilla]

In simplest form you can do

	kget -incore -

to list current in core parameters, or

	kget kernel_file -

to see settings of another kernel.

or

	kget -incore - /stand/vanilla

to produce list of changes from 'vanilla' configuration. You can redirect this
list to /kernel.config file with no changes - it already contains required
keywords.

Credits (according to jkh) go to Eric L. Hernes for 95% of this code. The
rest is mine :-)
