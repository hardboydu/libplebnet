Warsaw, 1998.10.21

This is a port of Minix editor. It's small, fast and relatively
robust. It can perform basic editing commands, block operations,
and search and replace.

The keybindings are just plain insane. I added a help screen
(available under F1), and remapped some of the wildest keys to
function keys. If you have some time and a bit of hacking skills,
you're welcome to sanitize it. :-)

A bit of warning: one of the reasons for its small size is that it
doesn't use any termcap calls - it uses hardwired codes for 'cons25'
terminal type. If you try to use it with some other terminal, you
have to change them, or recompile with -DUNIX -ltermcap.
