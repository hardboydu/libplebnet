This is a small HTTP server. This version is under BSD license.
It's very simple, yet sufficient for serving basic Web contents,
including ability to run CGI scripts.

How to use it?
==============

Compile, and run:

	simple_httpd <port>

If you're root, the document directory will be /httphome. If you're
not, then first of all you need to use the <port> option (>1023).
Then, the document root will be ${HOME}/httphome.

Log messages will be written out to /var/log/jhttpd.log .
