Warsaw, 1998.10.21

This is a port of Minix /bin/sh shell.

It's quite limited, but also quite small. One of most serious
limitations is lack of support for user-defined functions. Also,
globbing should be implemented with our glob(3) - the version in
sh4.c is rather primitive.

This is a copyrighted software - see the file LICENSE. In short,
it allows you to use it for research and educational purposes only.
