<center><h1>History and List of Bugfixes</h1></center>

<p>This is the short release history of PicoBSD, as well as the list of bugs
which were found. Some of them were already corrected, so that you should read
the list before reporting a new one.</p>

<p>We tried to make this software bug-free, but life is life... Sorry for the
 inconvenience.</p>

<h3>PicoBSD 0.4</h3>
<ul>
<li>
	1998.08.19: PicoBSD 0.4 released.
	<p>New features include: NATd,
	netstat, DEVFS/SLICE instead of standard /dev, additional network
	drivers, and several minor fixes. Distribution contains also
	a collection of small versions of system programs (TinyWare), among
	them custom init(8).</p>
	<p>I added also the fourth type of setup - 'router' - which is a
	specialized version of PicoBSD that focuses on providing as small
	as possible router solution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>PicoBSD 0.31</h3>
<ul>
<li>
	1998.03.28: Some people reported that the binary files (*.flp) were
	being corrupted during download because their browsers assumed that
	these are text files. I changed the names to *.bin - their contents
	 is the same.
</li>
<li>
	1998.03.20: PicoBSD 0.31 released. New features include: SNMP daemon,
	better creation of /kernel.config, some other minor fixes. Massive
	changes in the building scripts. I also removed vn(4) driver from
	"net" and "isp" floppies.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>PicoBSD 0.3</h3>
<p>The following bugs were found in this release of PicoBSD:</p>
<ul>
<li>	1998.02.27: A bug in kget(8) utility caused it to dump core in certain
	situations. As a consequence, it wasn't possible to save the changes
	made in UserConfig (-c). This will be corrected in the next release (or
	bugfix issue).
</li>
<li>	1998.02.24: Wrongly sized MFS caused the passwd(1) on "net" type
	floppy to fail because of lack of space for temporary files. This bug
	affected only "net" floppies, and of course the scripts ("2000" looks
	quite similar to "2200" :-(( ). Also, the 'update' script didn't work
	as expected...
<p>	This was fixed the same day, and the corrected files are: pb03en1.zip,
	pb03pn1.zip, and pbsd-s031.tgz respectively. They are now under standard
	links on the main page of PicoBSD project, so if you downloaded after
	this date, you shouldn't worry.</p>
<p>	Please check that you have the fixed versions - the archive name should
	contain the tiny number, such as "pb03en<b>1</b>.zip", or
	pbsd-s03<b>1</b>.tgz".</p>
<li>
	1998.02.15: PicoBSD 0.3 released. This is the first version that I can
	truly recommend - previous one was too buggy... :-)
</li>
</li>
</ul>
