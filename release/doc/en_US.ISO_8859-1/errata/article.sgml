	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>If you read no other documentation before installing this
    version of &os;, you should at least by all means <emphasis>read
    the errata</emphasis> for this release so that you don't stumble
    over problems which have already been found and fixed.  This
    <filename>ERRATA.TXT</filename> file is obviously already out of
    date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the net and
    should be consulted as the <quote>current errata</quote> for your
    release.  These other copies of the errata are located at:
