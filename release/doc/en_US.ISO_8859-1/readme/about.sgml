  <title>About &os;</title>

  <para>What is &os;?  &os; is an operating system based on 4.4 BSD
  Lite for Intel, AMD, Cyrix or NexGen <quote>x86</quote> based PC
  hardware and Compaq (formerly DEC) Alpha computers.  Versions for
  the IA64 and PowerPC architectures are currently under
  development as well.  &os; works with a
  very wide variety of PC peripherals and configurations and can be
  used for everything from software development to Internet Service
  Provision.</para>

  <para>This release of &os; contains everything you need to run
  such a system, including full source code for everything.  With the
  source distribution installed you can literally recompile the entire
  system from scratch with one command, making it ideal for students,
  researchers or folks who simply want to see how it all works.</para>

  <para>A large collection of third party ported software (the
  <quote>Ports Collection</quote>) is also provided to make it easier
  for you to obtain and install all your favorite traditional UNIX
  utilities for &os;.  Over 5000 ports, from editors to programming
  languages to graphical applications, make &os; a powerful and
  comprehensive operating environment that extends far beyond what's
  provided by many commercial versions of UNIX.</para>

  <para>For more documentation on this system it is recommended that
  you purchase The Complete FreeBSD, available from local bookstores
  and from The FreeBSD Mall (<ulink
  url="http://www.freebsdmall.com">http://www.freebsdmall.com</ulink>),
  as well as the 4.4BSD Document Set from O'Reilly Associates and the
  USENIX Association, ISBN 1-56592-082-1.  We have no connection with
  O'Reilly, we're just satisfied customers!</para>

  <para>If you're new to &os; then you should also read
  <emphasis>everything</emphasis>
  listed in the Documentation menu on the boot floppy.  It may seem
  like a lot to read, but you should at least acquaint yourself with
  the types of information available should you later get stuck.  Once
  the system is installed, you can also revisit this menu and use a
  Web browser to read the installed FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
  and Handbook HTML documentation sets for &os;.  Note that on-line
  versions of the <ulink
  url="http://www.freebsd.org/faq/">FAQ</ulink> and <ulink
  url="http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/">Handbook</ulink> are also
  available from the <ulink
  url="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD Project Web
  site</ulink>, if you have an Internet connection. See
  <filename>README.TXT</filename> for more information on the
  resources available to you.</para>

  <note>
    <para>If you read no other documentation before installing a given
    version of &os;, you should at least by all means <emphasis>read
    the errata</emphasis> for that release so that you don't stumble
    over problems which have already been found and fixed.  The
    <filename>ERRATA.TXT</filename> file accompanying your release (it
    should be right next to this file) is obviously already out of
    date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the net
    and should be consulted as the <quote>current errata</quote> for
    your release (this is also what your
    <filename>ERRATA.TXT</filename> file says, by the way).  These
    other copies of the errata are located at:

      <orderedlist>

          <para>ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/your-release/ERRATA.TXT
          (and any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this
          location).</para>

  </note>

  <warning>

    <para>While &os; does its best to safeguard against accidental
    loss of data, it's still more than possible to <emphasis>wipe out
    your entire disk</emphasis>
    with this installation!  Please do not proceed to the
    final &os; installation menu unless you've adequately backed up
    any important data first!  We really mean it!</para>
