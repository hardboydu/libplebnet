  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This is a binary snapshot of &os; &release.current;, the
  &release.branch; branch that is currently moving towards
  &release.next;.</para>

  <para>Feedback or offers to help with anything you see in this
  release are most welcome and should be sent to one of the
  appropriate mailing lists, as listed in <xref linkend="contacting">.</para>

  <sect2>
    <title>Target Audience</title>

    <para>This release is aimed primarily at early-adopters and the
    various other folks who want to get involved with the ongoing
    development of &os; and are willing to deal with a few bumps in
    the road.  We do our best to ensure that each snapshot works as
    advertised, but tracking -CURRENT is a process which frequently
    has its off days.</para>

    <para>If you're both technically proficient and know exactly what
    you're getting into here (e.g. you've been following -CURRENT)
    then this snapshot is probably for you.  If you're more interested
    in doing business with &os; than in playing with the cutting
    edge of technology, however, then 3.x or 4.x is almost certainly
    your best bet.</para>

    <para>If you're a developer/hobbiest and not interested in QA'd
    releases so much as simply keeping up to date on the latest &os;
    technology, you can also install one of our
    <quote>snapshot</quote> releases.
