  <title>Obtaining &os;</title>

  <para>You may obtain &os; in a variety of ways.  This section
  focuses on those ways that are primarily of use for obtaining a
  complete &os; distribution, rather than updating an existing
  installation.  More information can be found in the <ulink
  url="http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/mirrors.html"><quote>Obtaining
  FreeBSD</quote></ulink> appendix to the <ulink
  url="http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/">FreeBSD
  Handbook</ulink>.</para>

    <title>CDROM</title>
    <para>&os; 4.x-RELEASE and 3.x-RELEASE may be ordered on
    CDROM from:
    <address>
    BSDi
    <street>4041 Pike Lane, Suite D</street>
    <city>Concord</city> <state>CA</state> <postcode>94520</postcode>
    <country>USA</country>
    <phone>+1-800-786-9907</phone>
    <phone>+1-925-674-0783</phone>
    <fax>+1-925-674-0821 (FAX)</fax></address>
    </para>

    <para>Orders may also be placed via the Internet from
    <email>orders@cdrom.com</email> or <ulink
    url="http://www.cdrom.com/">http://www.cdrom.com/</ulink>.  A
    current catalog can be obtained via ftp from <ulink
    url="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/cdrom/catalog">ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/cdrom/catalog</ulink>.</para>

    <para>As of this writing, the cost per -RELEASE CDROM set is $39.95 
    (US Dollars) or $24.95 with a &os;
    subscription.  &os; SNAPshot CDROM sets, when available, are $39.95 or
    $14.95 with a &os;-SNAP subscription (-RELEASE and -SNAP
    subscriptions are entirely separate).  With a subscription, you
    will automatically receive updates as they are released.  Your
    credit card will be billed when each disk is shipped and you may
    cancel your subscription at any time without further
    obligation.</para>

    <para>Shipping (per order not per disk) is $5.00 in the United
    States, Canada or Mexico and $9.00 overseas.  BSDi accepts Visa,
    Mastercard, Discover, American Express or checks in U.S. Dollars
    and ships COD within the United States.  California residents
    please add 8.25% sales tax.</para>

    <para>Should you be dissatisfied for any reason, the CDROM comes with
    an unconditional return policy.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>FTP</title>

    <para>You can use FTP to retrieve &os; and any or all of its
    optional packages from <ulink
    url="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/">ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/</ulink>, which
    is the
    official &os; release site.</para>

    <para>For other locations that mirror the &os; software see the
    file <filename>MIRROR.SITES</filename>.  
    Please FTP the distribution from the site
    closest (in networking terms) to you.  Additional mirror sites are
    always welcome!  
    Contact <email>freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org</email> for more
    details if you'd like to become an official mirror site.</para>

    <para>Mirrors generally contain the floppy disk images necessary
    to begin an installation, as well as the distribution files needed
    for the install process itself.  Some mirrors also contain some of
    the ISO images necessary to create a CDROM of a &os; release.</para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Email</title>

    <para>If you do not have access to the Internet and electronic
    mail is your only recourse, then you may still fetch the files by
    sending mail to <email>ftpmail@ftpmail.vix.com</email> - putting
    the keyword <literal>help</literal> in your message to get more
    information on how to fetch files from a &os; FTP archive using
    this mechanism.  Please do note, however, that this will end up
    sending many <emphasis>tens of megabytes</emphasis> through the
    mail and should only be employed as an absolute
    <emphasis>last</emphasis> resort!</para>
