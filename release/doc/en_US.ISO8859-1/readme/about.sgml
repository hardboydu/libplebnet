  <title>About &os;</title>

  <para>&os; is an operating system based on 4.4 BSD
  Lite for Intel, AMD, Cyrix or NexGen <quote>x86</quote> based PC
  hardware and Compaq (formerly DEC) Alpha computers.  Versions for
  the IA64 and PowerPC architectures are currently under
  development as well.  &os; works with a
  wide variety of peripherals and configurations and can be
  used for everything from software development to games to Internet Service
  Provision.</para>

  <para>This release of &os; contains everything you need to run
  such a system, including full source code for the kernel and all
  utilities in the base distribution.  With the
  source distribution installed, you can literally recompile the entire
  system from scratch with one command, making it ideal for students,
  researchers, or users who simply want to see how it all works.</para>

  <para>A large collection of third-party ported software (the
  <quote>Ports Collection</quote>) is also provided to make it easy
  to obtain and install all your favorite traditional UNIX
  utilities for &os;.  Each
  <quote>port</quote> consists of a set of scripts to retrieve,
  configure, build, and install a piece of software, with a single
  command.  Over 5000 ports, from editors to programming
  languages to graphical applications, make &os; a powerful and
  comprehensive operating environment that extends far beyond what's
  provided by many commercial versions of UNIX.  Most ports are also
  available as pre-compiled <quote>packages</quote>, which can be
  quickly installed from the installation program.</para>

  <para>Pointers to more documentation on &os; can be found in the
  <ulink
  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/bibliography.html#BIBLIOGRAPHY-FREEBSD">Books
  &amp; Magazines Specific to FreeBSD</ulink> section of the &os; Handbook.
  Because of &os;'s strong UNIX heritage, many other articles and books written
  for UNIX systems are applicable as well.  A selection of these documents
  can be found in the Handbook's <ulink
  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/bibliography.html">Bibliography</ulink>.
  </para>

  <para>If you're new to &os; then you should also read
  all of the documentation files listed in <xref linkend="release-docs">,
  all of which are available from the Documentation menu in the
  installation program.
  It may seem
  like a lot to read, but it's important to at least acquaint yourself with
  the types of information available, should you run into problems later.  Once
  the system is installed, you can also revisit this menu by running
  the &man.sysinstall.8; utility.</para>

  <para>On-line
  versions of the <ulink
  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/">FAQ</ulink>
  (Frequently Asked Questions document) and <ulink
  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">Handbook</ulink> are always
  available from the <ulink
  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/docs.html">FreeBSD Documentation
  page</ulink> or its mirrors.
  If you install the
  <filename>doc</filename> distribution set, you can use a
  Web browser to read the FAQ and Handbook locally.</para>

  <note>
    <para>It is extremely important to read the errata for any given
    release before installing it, to learn about any
    <quote>late-breaking news</quote> or post-release problems.
    The
    errata file accompanying each release 
    (most likely right next to this file) is already out of
    date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet
    and should be consulted as the <quote>current errata</quote> for
    this release.  These
    other copies of the errata are located at
    <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>
    (as well as any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this
    location).</para>
