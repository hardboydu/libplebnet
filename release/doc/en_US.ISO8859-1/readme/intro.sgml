  <para>This distribution is a &release.type; of &os; &release.current;, the
  latest point along the &release.branch; branch.</para>

    <title>Target Audience</title>

<![ %release.type.snapshot; [
    <para>This &release.type; is aimed primarily at early adopters and
    various other users who want to get involved with the ongoing
    development of &os;.  While the &os; development team tries its
    best to ensure that each &release.type; works as
    advertised, &release.branch; is very much a work-in-progress.</para>

    <para>The basic requirements for using this &release.type are
    technical proficiency with &os; and an understanding of the ongoing
    development process of &os; &release.current; 
    (as discussed on the &a.current;).</para>

    <para>For those more interested
    in doing business with &os; than in experimenting with new &os; 
    technology, formal releases (such as &release.prev;) are frequently more
    appropriate.  Releases undergo a period of testing and quality
    assurance checking to ensure high reliability and dependability.</para>

    undergone a period of testing and quality assurance

    <para>A number of other files provide more specific information
    about this &release.type; distribution.  These files are provided
    in various formats.  Most distributions will include both ASCII
    text (<filename>.TXT</filename>) and HTML
    (<filename>.HTM</filename>) renditions.  Some distributions may
    also include other formats such as PostScript
    (<filename>.PS</filename>) or Portable Document Format
    (<filename>.PDF</filename>).

	  snapshots).  It is important to consult this file before

	  the latest information on problems which have been found and
	  fixed since the release was created.</para>
