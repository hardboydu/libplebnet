  <title>Obtaining &os;</title>

  <para>&os; may be obtained in a variety of ways.  This section
  focuses on those ways that are primarily of use for obtaining a
  complete &os; distribution, rather than updating an existing
  installation.</para>

  <sect2>
    <title>CDROM and DVD</title>

    <para>&os; -RELEASE distributions (for example, 4.3-RELEASE) may
    be ordered on CDROM or DVD from several publishers.  This is
    frequently the most convenient way to obtain &os; for new
    installations, as it provides a convenient way to quickly
    reinstall the system if necessary.  Some distributions include
    some of the optional, precompiled <quote>packages</quote> from the
    &os; Ports Collection.</para>

    <para>A list of the CDROM and DVD
    publishers known to the project are listed in the <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors.html"><quote>Obtaining
    FreeBSD</quote></ulink> appendix to the Handbook.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>FTP</title>

    <para>You can use FTP to retrieve &os; and any or all of its
    optional packages from <ulink
    url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/"></ulink>, which
    is the
    official &os; release site, or any of its <quote>mirrors</quote>.</para>

    <para>Lists of locations that mirror &os;
    can be found in the <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html">FTP
    Sites</ulink> section of the Handbook, or on the
    <ulink url="http://www.freebsdmirrors.org/"></ulink> Web pages.
    Finding a close (in networking terms) mirror from which to
    download the distribution is highly recommended.</para>

    <para>Additional mirror sites are
    always welcome.
    Contact <email>freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org</email> for more
    details on becoming an official mirror site.</para>

    <para>Mirrors generally contain the floppy disk images necessary
    to begin an installation, as well as the distribution files needed
    for the install process itself.  Some mirrors also contain some of
    the ISO images necessary to create a CDROM of a &os; release.</para>
