  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.  Some
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink

  <para>Users who are new to the &release.branch; series of &os;
    &release.type;s should also read the <quote>Early Adopters Guide
    to &os; &release.current;</quote>.  This document can generally be
    found in the same location as the release notes (either as a part of a
    &os; distribution or on the &os; Web site).  It contains important
    information regarding the advantages and disadvantages of using
    &os; &release.current;, as opposed to releases based on the &os;
    4-STABLE development branch.</para>

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
<![ %include.historic; [
      the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
      since &release.prev;.
      In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
      branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.
]]>
<![ %no.include.historic; [
      many of the user-visible new or changed features in &os;
      since &release.prev;.  It includes items that are unique to the
      &release.branch; branch, as well as some features that may have been
      recently merged to
      other branches (after &os; &release.prev.historic;).  The latter
      items are marked as &merged;.
]]>
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev.historic;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>A single-byte buffer overflow in &man.realpath.3; was
      fixed.  Although the fix was committed prior to &os;
      &release.prev; (and thus &release.prev; was not affected),
      it was not noted in the release documentation.  See security advisory 
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:08.realpath.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:08</ulink>. &merged;</para>

    <para>A bug that could allow the kernel to attempt delivery of

    <para arch="i386">A bug that even when no AT keyboard is connected,
      &man.atkbd.4; registers an AT keyboard during console initialization
      has been fixed.  <command>kbdcontrol -k /dev/kbd1</command>
      is no longer needed when only a USB keyboard is connected.
      &merged;</para>

    <para arch="i386,pc98">The DRM kernel modules have been updated from
      DRI CVS as of 9 September 2003.  Among other changes, this

      been added.  This addition improves the handling of PCI busses.
      One user-visible change is that the enumeration of devices is
      closer to &solaris; (as a result of this change, the numbering
      of devices may change if more than one unit of a device type is
      present).  The <literal>OFW_NEWPCI</literal> kernel
      configuration is enabled by default in the
      <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.</para>

    <para arch="i386,pc98">The &man.hifn.4; driver now supports 
      symmetric crypto for the 7955 and 7956 chipsets.

      &man.watchdogd.8;.</para>

    <!-- Above this line, sort kernel changes by manpage/keyword-->

    <para>The swap pager has been revamped.  Among user-visible
      changes are a change in the layout policy (from fixed-width
      striping to a round-robin across devices) for better I/O
      throughput, the elimination of compile-time limits on the number
      of swap devices, and a reduction in memory overheads.</para>

        (such as <literal>1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8/30, 9.10.11.12/22</literal>),
        and allow spaces after commas to make lists of addresses more readable.
        &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.ipfw.4; rules now support C++-style comments.
        Each comment is stored together with its rule and appears using

      <para>&man.ipfw.8; can now modify &man.ipfw.4; rules in set 31,
        which was read-only and used for the default rules.
        They can be deleted by <command>ipfw delete set 31</command>
        command but are not deleted
        by the <command>ipfw flush</command> command.

      <para>A major rework of the &man.ata.4; driver has been
	committed.  One of the more notable changes is that the
	&man.ata.4; driver has now out from under the Giant kernel
	lock.  Note that ATA software RAID systems must now include
	<literal>device ataraid</literal> in their kernel
	configuration files, as it is no longer automatically implied
	by <literal>device atadisk</literal>.</para>

      <para>&man.ccd.4; can now operate on raw disks and other
	&man.geom.4; providers.</para>

      <para>The &man.da.4; driver no longer tries to send 6-byte
	commands to USB and Firewire devices.  The quirks for these
	devices (which hopefully are now unnecessary) have been
	disabled; to restore the old behavior, add <literal>options
	DA_OLD_QUIRKS</literal> to the kernel configuration. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.arp.8; now supports a <option>-i</option> option
      to limit the scope of the current operation to the ARP entries
      on a particular interface.  This option applies to the display
      operations only.  It should be useful on routers with numerous

    <para>The dev_db utility is unnecessary due to the mandatory
      presence of devfs, and has been removed.</para>

    <para>&man.dhclient.8; now polls the state of network interfaces
      and only sends DHCP requests on interfaces that are up.  The
      polling interval can be controlled with the <option>-i</option>
      option.</para>

      specify multi-byte character sets using this option.</para>

    <para>The &man.mount.msdosfs.8; utility now supports a
      <option>-M</option> option to specify the maximum file
      permissions for directories in the file system. &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.mount.msdosfs.8; utility now supports a
      <option>-D</option> option to specify MS-DOS codepages and a
      <option>-L</option> option to specify local character sets.  They are
      used to convert character sets of filenames.  The
      <filename>/usr/libdata/msdosfs</filename> tables have

    <para>A number of utilities available in <filename>/bin</filename>

      the <filename>/stand</filename> directory installed by
      &man.sysinstall.8;, but <filename>/rescue</filename> includes
      more functionality and is updated as part of
      <literal>buildworld</literal>/<literal>installworld</literal> operations.  More details can be found in
      &man.rescue.8;.

    <para>It is now possible to build <filename>/bin</filename> and
      <filename>/sbin</filename> directories containing
      dynamically-linked executables.  This feature brings support for
      loadable PAM and NSS modules to base system utilities located in
      those directories.  It also reduces the storage requirements for
      the root filesystem due to the use of shared libraries.  This
      feature can be enabled in a <literal>buildworld</literal> by
      defining the Makefile variable
      <varname>WITH_DYNAMICROOT</varname>.</para>
