  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
<![ %include.historic; [
      the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
      since &release.prev;.
      In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
      branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.
]]>
<![ %no.include.historic; [
      many of the user-visible new or changed features in &os;
      since &release.prev;.  It includes items that are unique to the
      &release.branch; branch, as well as some features that may have been
      recently merged to
      other branches (after &os; &release.prev.historic;).  The later
      items are marked as &merged;.

  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bugfixes, or contributed software upgrades.  Applicable security
    advisories issued after &release.prev.historic; are also listed.</para>

  <para>Many additional changes were made to &os; that are not listed
    here for lack of space.  For example, documentation was corrected
    and improved, minor bugs were fixed, insecure coding practices
    were audited and corrected, and source code was cleaned up.</para>

  <sect2 id="security">
    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>A remotely exploitable vulnerability in
      <application>CVS</application> has been corrected with the
      import of version 1.11.5.  More details can be found in security
      advisory <ulink

    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para arch="pc98">Support for the CanBe power management
      controller has been added.</para>

    <para>&man.devfs.5; is now mandatory; the
      <literal>NODEVFS</literal> option has been removed from the set of
      possible kernel configuration options.</para>

    <!-- Above this line, sort kernel changes by manpage/keyword-->

    <para>A second process scheduler, designed to be a general purpose
      scheduler with many SMP benefits, has been added to the scheduler
      framework.  Exactly one scheduler must be specified in a kernel
      configuration.  The original scheduler may be selected using
      <literal>options&nbsp;SCHED_4BSD</literal>.  The newer
      (experimental) scheduler can be selected by using
      <literal>options&nbsp;SCHED_ULE</literal>.</para>

      <title>Bootloader Changes</title>

      <para arch="alpha">The alpha boot loader
        (<filename>boot1</filename>) can now be called
        <filename>boot</filename> for consistency with other
        platforms.</para>

      <para arch="i386,pc98">The two parts of the boot loader
        (<filename>boot1</filename> and <filename>boot2</filename>)
        have been combined into a single <filename>boot</filename>
        file, to simplify programs that need to write or otherwise
        manipulate the boot loader.</para>

      <para arch="pc98">The PC98 bootloader now has support for
        booting from SCSI MO media. &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.geom.4; is now mandatory; the
        <literal>NO_GEOM</literal> has been removed from the set of
        kernel configuration options.</para>

      <para>Support has been added for volume labels on UFS and UFS2
        filesystems.  These labels are strings that can be used to
        identify a volume, regardless of what device it appears on.
        Labels can be set with the <option>-L</option> options to
        &man.newfs.8; or &man.tunefs.8;.  With the
        <literal>GEOM_VOL</literal> module, volumes can be accessed
        using their labels under <filename>/dev/vol</filename>.</para>

  <sect2 id="userland">
    <title>Userland Changes</title>

    <para>The <option>-N</option> and <option>-W</option> flags to
      &man.disklabel.8; have been retired.</para>

    <para>&man.disklabel.8; is now only built for architectures where
      it is useful (i386, pc98, alpha, and ia64).</para>

    <para>The <option>-s</option> to &man.disklabel.8; has been
      removed because the i386 boot loader now resides in a single
      file.</para>

    <para>&man.dump.8; now supports caching of disk blocks with the
      <option>-C</option> option.  This can improve dump performance
      at the cost of possibly missing filesystem updates that occur
      between passes.</para>

    <para>&man.dumpfs.8; now supports a <option>-m</option> flag to
      print file system parameters in the form of a &man.newfs.8;
      command.</para>

    <para>&man.elfdump.1;, a utility to display information about &man.elf.5;
      format executable files, has been added.</para>

    <para>&man.fetch.1; uses the <filename>.netrc</filename> support
      in &man.fetch.3; and also supports a <option>-N</option> to
      specify an alternate <filename>.netrc</filename> file.</para>

    <para>&man.fetch.3; now has support for
      <filename>.netrc</filename> files (see &man.ftp.1; for more
      details).</para>

    <para>&man.ftpd.8; now supports a <option>-h</option> option to
      disable printing any host-specific information, such as the
      &man.ftpd.8; version or hostname, in server messages.</para>

    <para>&man.ftpd.8; now supports a <option>-P</option> option to
      specify a port on which to listen in daemon mode.  The default
      data port number is now set to be one less than the control port
      number, rather than being hard-coded.</para>

    <para>&man.ftpd.8; now supports an extended format of the
      <filename>/etc/ftpchroot</filename> file.  Please refer
      to the &man.ftpchroot.5; manpage, which is now available,
      for details.</para>

    <para>&man.ftpd.8; now supports login directory pathnames
      that specify simultaneously a directory for &man.chroot.2;
      and that to change to in the chrooted environment.  The
      <quote><literal>/./</literal></quote> separator is used for
      this purpose, like in other FTP daemons having this feature.
      It may be used in both &man.ftpchroot.5; and &man.passwd.5;.</para>

    <para>&man.fwcontrol.8; now supports <option>-R</option> and
      <option>-S</option> options for receiving and sending DV
      streams. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.ipfw.8; now supports <literal>enable</literal> and
      <literal>disable</literal> commands to control various aspects
      of the operation of &man.ipfw.4; (including enabling and
      disabling the firewall itself).  These provide a more convenient
      and visible interface than the existing sysctl
      variables. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.kenv.1; has been moved from
      <filename>/usr/bin</filename> to <filename>/bin</filename> to
      make it available at times during system startup when only the
      root filesystem is mounted.</para>

    <para>The MAKEDEV script is now unnecessary, due to the mandatory
      presence of &man.devfs.5;, and has been removed.</para>

    <para>&man.newsyslog.8; now supports a <literal>W</literal> flag
      to force previously-started compression jobs for an entry (or
      group of entries specified with the <literal>G</literal> flag)
      to finish before beginning a new one.  This feature is designed
      to prevent system overloads caused by starting several
      compression jobs on big files simultaneously. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.ping.8; now supports a <option>-D</option> flag to set
      the <quote>Don't Fragment</quote> bit on outgoing packets.</para>

    <para>&man.ping.8; now supports a <option>-z</option> flag to set
      the Type of Service bits in outgoing packets.</para>

    <para arch="sparc64">The sunlabel utility, a program analogous to
      &man.disklabel.8; that works on Sun disk labels, has been
      added.</para>

    <para>The &man.swapoff.8; command has been added to disable paging
      and swapping on a device.  A related &man.swapctl.8; command has
      been added to provide an interface to &man.swapon.8; and
      &man.swapoff.8; similar to other BSDs.

      <note>
        <para>The &man.swapoff.8; feature should be considered
	  experimental.</para>
      </note>
    </para>

    <para>&man.systat.1; now includes an <option>-ifstat</option>
      display mode that displays the network traffic going through
      active intrfaces on the system.</para>

    <para>&man.xargs.1; now supports a <option>-P</option> option to
      execute multiple copies of the same utility in parallel.</para>

        version 8.3.4. &merged;</para>

      <para>All of the <application>bzip2</application> suite of
        applications is now installed in the base system (in
        particular, <command>bzip2recover</command> is now built and
        installed. &merged;</para>

      <para><application>CVS</application> has been updated to
	1.11.5. &merged;</para>

      <para>The <application>ISC DHCP</application> client has been
	updated to 3.0.1RC11.</para>

      <para><application>libpcap</application> now has support for
	selecting among multiple data link types on an
	interface.</para>

      <para><application>OpenPAM</application> has been updated to the
        <quote>Daffodil</quote> release.</para>

      <para><application>OpenSSL</application> has been updated to
        release 0.9.7.  Among other features, this release includes
        support for AES and takes advantage of &man.crypto.4;
        devices.</para>

      <para>&man.tcpdump.1; now supports a <option>-L</option> flag to
	list the data link types available on an interface and a
	<option>-y</option> to specify the data link type to use while
	capturing packages.</para>

  <title>Upgrading from previous releases of &os;</title>

  <para>Users with existing &os; systems are
    <emphasis>highly</emphasis> encouraged to read the <quote>Early
    Adopter's Guide to &os; 5.0</quote>.  This document generally has
    the filename <filename>EARLY.TXT</filename> on the distribution
    media, or any other place that the release notes can be found.  It
    offers some notes on upgrading, but more importantly, also
    discusses some of the relative merits of upgrading to &os;
    5.<replaceable>X</replaceable> versus running &os;
    4.<replaceable>X</replaceable>.</para>
