  <abstract>
    <para>The release notes for &os; &release.current; contain a summary
      of the changes made to the &os; base system on the
      &release.branch; development line.
      This document lists applicable security advisories that were issued since
      the last release, as well as significant changes to the &os;
      kernel and userland.
      Some brief remarks on upgrading are also presented.</para>

  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.current [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents the latest point along the &release.branch; development
    branch since &release.branch; was created.  Information regarding pre-built, binary
    &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.
    Information regarding
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
    url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.  More
    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink
    url="&url.books.handbook;/mirrors.html"><quote>Obtaining
    &os;</quote> appendix</ulink> to the <ulink
    url="&url.books.handbook;/">&os;
    Handbook</ulink>.</para>

]]>

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.
    In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
    branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev.historic;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>kern.malloc_stats</varname>
      has been added.  This allows to export kernel malloc
      statistics via a binary structure stream.</para>

    <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>vm.zone_stats</varname>
      has been added.  This allows to export &man.uma.9; allocator
      statistics via a binary structure stream.</para>

      <para>The &man.mpt.4; driver has been updated to support
	various new features such as RAID volume and RAID member
	state/settings reporting, periodic volume re-synchronization
	status reporting, and sysctl variables for volume
	re-synchronization rate, volume member write cache status,
	and volume transaction queue depth.</para>

      <para>A new GEOM-based disk encryption facility, GEOM_ELI, has been
	added.  It uses the &man.crypto.9; framework for hardware acceleration
	and supports different cryptographic algorithms.  See &man.geli.8; for

      potentially sensitive keying material to standard output.
      This sensitive information will not be printed by default.</para>

    <para>The &man.libmemstat.3; library has been added.
      This is for use by debugging and monitoring applications
      in tracking kernel memory statistics.  It provides an
      abstracted interface to &man.uma.9; and &man.malloc.9;
      statistics, wrapped around the binary stream sysctl variables
      for the allocators. &merged;</para>
