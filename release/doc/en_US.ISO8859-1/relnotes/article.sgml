  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
  features in &os; since &release.prev;.  All changes
  described here are unique to the &release.branch; branch unless
  specifically marked as &merged; features.</para>

  <para>Many additional changes were made to &os; that are not listed
  here for lack of space.  For example, documentation was corrected
  and improved, minor bugs were fixed, insecure coding practices were
  audited and corrected, and source code was cleaned up.</para>

  <sect2>
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para>The &man.kqueue.2; event notification facility was added to
    the &os; kernel.  This is a new interface which is able to
    replace &man.poll.2;/&man.select.2, offering improved performance,
    as well as the ability to report many different types of events.
    Support for monitoring changes in sockets, pipes, fifos, and files
    are present, as well as for signals and processes. &merged;</para>

    <para arch="i386">Support for Intel's Wired for Management 2.0 (PXE)
    was added to the FreeBSD boot loader.  Due to API differences, the
    older PXE versions are not supported.  This allow network booting
    using DHCP. &merged;</para>

    <para>Support for USB devices was added to the
    <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel and to the installation
    programs to support USB devices out of the box.  Note that SRM
    does not support USB devices at the moment, so you must still use
    an AT keyboard if you are not using a serial console. &merged;</para>

    <para>POSIX.1b Shared Memory Objects are now supported.  The
    implementation uses regular files, but automatically enables the
    MAP_NOSYNC flag when they are &man.mmap.2;-ed. &merged;</para>

    <para arch="i386">A driver for AGP hardware has been added. &merged;</para>

    <para>The kernel and modules have been moved to the directory
    <filename>/boot/kernel</filename>, so they can be easily
    manipulated together.  The boot loader has been updated to make
    this change as seamless as possible.</para>

    <para arch="i386">The i386 boot loader now has support for a 
    <literal>nullconsole</literal>
    console type, for use on systems with neither a video console nor
    a serial port. &merged;</para>

    <para>Replaced the <literal>PQ_*CACHE</literal> options with a
    single <literal>PQ_CACHESIZE</literal> option to be set to
    the cache size in kilobytes.  The old options are still supported
    for backwards compatibility. &merged;</para>

    <para arch="i386">The <literal>NCPU</literal>, <literal>NAPIC</literal>,
    <literal>NBUS</literal>, and <literal>NINTR</literal> kernel
    configuration options, for configuring SMP kernels, have been
    removed.  <literal>NCPU</literal> is now set to a maximum of 16,
    and the other, aforementioned options are now
    dynamic. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.devfs.5;, which allows entries in the
    <filename>/dev</filename> directory to be built automatically and
    supports more flexible attachment of devices, has been largely
    reworked.  &man.devfs.5; is now enabled by default and can be
    disabled by the <literal>NODEVFS</literal> kernel option.</para>

    <para arch="i386">Preliminary Cardbus support under NEWCARD has been added.
    This code supports the TI113X, TI12XX, TI125X, Ricoh 5C46/5C47, Topic
    95/97/100 and Cirrus Logic PD683X bridges.  16-bit PC Card support
    is not yet functional.</para>

    <para>Write combining for crashdumps has been implemented.  This
    feature is useful when write caching is disabled on both SCSI and
    IDE disks, where large memory dumps could take up to an hour to
    complete. &merged;</para>

    <para>Extremely large swap areas (&gt;67 GB) no longer panic the
    system.</para>

    <para arch="i386">The &man.ichsmb.4; driver for the Intel 82801AA
    (ICH) SMBus controller and compatibles has been
    added. &merged;</para>

    <para arch="i386">The &man.uscanner.4; driver for basic USB scanner support
    using SANE has been added. See <ulink
    url="http://www.mostang.com/sane/">the SANE home page</ulink> for
    supported scanners. The HP ScanJet 4100C, 5200C and 6300C are
    known to be working.</para>

    <para arch="i386">The umodem driver for USB modems has been added.
    Support is provided for the 3Com 5605 and Metricom Ricochet GS
    wireless USB modems.</para>

    <para arch="alpha">Support for threads under Linux emulation has been
    added.</para>

    <para arch="i386">The pccard driver and &man.pccardc.8; now support multiple
    <quote>beep types</quote> upon card insertion and removal. &merged;</para>

    <para>A number of cleanups and enhancements have been applied to
    the PCI subsystem.
    <filename>/usr/share/misc/pci_vendors</filename> now contains a
    vendor/device database, which can be used by
    &man.pciconf.8;.</para>

    <para arch="i386">The &man.spic.4; driver, which provides access to the job
    dial device on some Sony laptops, has been added.</para>

    <para arch="i386">PECOFF (WIN32 Execution file format) support has been
    added.</para>

    <para>A VESA S3 linear framebuffer driver has been added.</para>

    <para>The <maketarget>buildkernel</maketarget> target now gets the
    name of the configuration(s) to build from the
    <varname>KERNCONF</varname> variable, not
    <varname>KERNEL</varname>.  It is no longer required, in some
    cases, for a <maketarget>buildworld</maketarget> to precede a
    <maketarget>buildkernel</maketarget>.  (The
    <maketarget>buildworld</maketarget> is still required when
    upgrading across major releases, across
    <application>binutil</application> upgrades and when &man.config.8;
    changes version.)
    </para>

    <para>The &man.random.4; device has been rewritten to use the
    <application>Yarrow</application> algorithm.  It harvests entropy
    from a variety of interrupt sources, including the console
    devices, Ethernet and point-to-point network interfaces, and
    mass-storage devices.  Entropy from the &man.random.4; device is
    now periodically saved to files in
    <filename>/var/db/entropy</filename>, as well as at
    &man.shutdown.8; time.</para>

    <para>The &man.syscons.4; driver now supports keyboard-controlled
    pasting, by default bound to
    <keycap>Shift</keycap>-<keycap>Insert</keycap>.</para>

    <para>The &man.labpc.4; driver has been removed due to
    <quote>bitrot</quote>.</para>

    <para>A new kernel option, <literal>options REGRESSION</literal>,
    enables interfaces and functionality intended for use during
    correctness and regression testing.</para>

    <para>The <literal>USER_LDT</literal> kernel option is now
    activated by default.</para>

    <para>A new &man.ddb.4; command <command>show pcpu</command> lists
    some of the per-CPU data.</para>

    <para>A new digi driver has been added to support PCI Xr-based and ISA
    Xem Digiboard cards.  A new digictl program is (mainly) used to
    re-initialise cards that have external port modules attached such as
    the PC/Xem.<para>

    <para>The <literal>O_DIRECT</literal> flag has been added to
    &man.open.2; and &man.fcntl.2;.  Specifying this flag for open
    files will attempt to minimize the cache effects of reading and
    writing. &merged;</para>

    <para><literal>OLDCARD</literal> and &man.pccardd.8; now support
    PCI cards.</para>

    <para>An &man.orm.4; device has been added to claim the option
    ROMs in the ISA memory I/O space, to prevent other drivers from
    mistakenly assigning addresses that conflict with these ROMs. &merged;</para>

    <para>The out-of-swap process termination code now begins killing
    processes earlier to avoid deadlocks; it now also takes into
    account the swap space used by processes when computing the
    process sizes. &merged;</para>

    <para>Linker sets are now self-contained; &man.gensetdefs.8; is
    unnecessary and has been removed.</para>

    <para>Numerous SMP-friendly changes have been made to the kernel's
    mbuf allocator.</para>

    <para>The dgm driver has been removed in favor of the digi driver.</para>

    <para>Network device cloning has been implemented, and the &man.gif.4;
    and &man.stf.4; devices have been modified to take advantage of it.
    Thus, instead of specifying how many &man.gif.4; or &man.stf.4; devices
    are available in kernel configuration files, &man.ifconfig.8;'s
    <option>create</option> option should be used when another device
    instance is desired.</para>

    <para>The kernel message buffer is now accessible by the
    (machine-independent) <varname>kern.msgbuf</varname> sysctl
    variable; &man.dmesg.8; no longer needs to be SGID
    <groupname>kmem</groupname>.</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Processor/Motherboard Support</title>

      <para>SMP support has been largely reworked, incorporating code
      from BSD/OS 5.0.  One of the main features of SMPng (<quote>SMP
      Next Generation</quote>) is to allow more processes to run in
      kernel, without the need for spin locks that can dramatically
      reduce the efficiency of multiple processors.  Interrupt
      handlers now have contexts associated with them that allow them
      to be blocked, which reduces the need to lock out
      interrupts.</para>

      <para arch="i386">Support for the 80386 processor has been
      removed from the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel, as this
      code seriously pessimizes performance on other ia32
      processors.</para>

      <para arch="i386">The <literal>I386_CPU</literal> kernel option
      to support the 80386 processor is now mutually exclusive with
      support for other ia32 processors; this should slightly improve
      performance on the 80386 due to the elimination of runtime
      processor type checks.</para>

      <para arch="i386">Custom kernels that will run on the 80386 can
      still be built by changing the cpu options in the kernel
      configuration file to only include
      <literal>I386_CPU</literal>.</para>

      <para arch="alpha">AlphaServer 1200 (<quote>Tincup</quote>) has
      been tested and works OK.  Currently it does not want to boot
      from CD or floppy but a transplanted disk that was installed on
      another Alpha works well. &merged;</para>

      <para arch="alpha">The API UP1100 mainboard has been verified to work.</para>

      <para arch="alpha">The API CS20 1U high server has been verified to work.</para>

      <para arch="alpha">The DEC3000 series support has been removed from the mfsroot
      floppy image so that it fits on a 1.44 Mbyte floppy again. As the 
      DEC3000 is currently only usable diskless this should not cause
      any problems.</para>

      <para arch="alpha">Support for AlphaServer 2100A (<quote>Lynx</quote>) has been
      added.</para>

      <para arch="alpha">Kernel code has been added that allows older generation Alpha CPUs
      (EV4 and EV5) to emulate instructions of the newer Alpha CPU 
      generations. This enables the use of binary-only programs like Adobe
      Acrobat 4 on EV4 and EV5.</para>

      <para arch="alpha">SMP support for the alpha is now operational.</para>

      <para arch="i386">Detection for new processors, such as the
      FC-PGA2 Pentium III (Tualatin), Transmeta Crusoe, and Transmeta
      Crusoe LongRun, has been added.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Network Interface Support</title>

      <para>Added support for PCI Ethernet adapters based on the
      National Semiconductor DP83815 chipset, including the NetGear
      FA311-TX and FA312-TX, in the form of the &man.sis.4; driver.</para>

      <para>The &man.tap.4; driver, a virtual Ethernet device driver for
      bridged configurations, has been added. &merged;</para>

      <para>The &man.ti.4; driver now supports the Alteon AceNIC
      1000baseT Gigabit Ethernet and Netgear GA620T 1000baseT Gigabit
      cards. &merged;</para>

      <para>The &man.xl.4; driver now supports the 3Com 3C556 and 3C556B
      MiniPCI adapters used on some laptops. &merged;</para>

      <para arch="alpha">The &man.ed.4; driver is now supported.</para>

      <para>The &man.pcn.4; driver, which supports the AMD PCnet/FAST,
      PCnet/FAST+, PCnet/FAST III, PCnet/PRO, PCnet/Home, and HomePNA
      adapters, has been added.  Although these cards are already
      supported by the &man.lnc.4; driver, the &man.pcn.4; driver runs
      these chips in 32-bit mode and uses the RX alignment feature to
      achieve zero-copy receive.  This driver is also
      machine-independent, so it will work on both the i386 and alpha
      platforms.  The &man.lnc.4; driver is still needed to support non-PCI
      cards. &merged;</para>

      <para>Support for Fujitsu MB86960A/MB86965A based Ethernet
      PC-Cards is back. &merged;</para>

      <para arch="i386">The snc driver for the National Semiconductor
      DP8393X (SONIC) Ethernet controller has been added.  Currently,
      this driver is only used on the PC-98 architecture. &merged;</para>

      <para>The &man.an.4; driver for Cisco Aironet cards now supports
      Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encryption, settable via
      &man.ancontrol.8;. &merged;</para>

      <para arch="i386">The &man.el.4; driver can now be loaded as a
      module.</para>

      <para>The &man.ray.4; driver, which supports the Webgear Aviator
      wireless network cards, has been committed.  The operation of
      &man.ray.4; interfaces can be modified by
      &man.raycontrol.8;. &merged;</para>

      <para arch="alpha">The &man.fpa.4; driver now supports Digital's
      DEFPA FDDI adaptors on the Alpha.</para>

      <para arch="i386">Linksys Fast Ethernet PCCARD cards supported by the
      &man.ed.4; driver now require the addition of flag
      <literal>0x80000</literal> to their config line in
      &man.pccard.conf.5;.  This flag is not optional.  These Linksys
      cards will not be recognized without it.</para>

      <para>A bug in the &man.ed.4; driver that could cause panics with
      very short packets and BPF or bridging active has been
      fixed. &merged;</para>

      <para>The &man.fxp.4; driver now requires a <literal>device
      miibus</literal> entry in the kernel configuration file. &merged;</para>

      <para>The &man.wx.4; driver now supports the Intel PRO1000-F and
      PRO1000-T (10/100/1000) adapters. &merged;</para>

      <para>Added the &man.nge.4; driver, which supports PCI Gigabit
      Ethernet adapters based on the National Semiconductor DP83820
      and DP83821 Gigabit Ethernet controller chips, including the
      D-Link DGE-500T, SMC EZ Card 1000 (SMC9462TX), Asante
      FriendlyNet GigaNIC 1000TA and 1000TPC and Addtron
      AEG320T.  This driver supports transmit and receive checksum
      offloading. &merged;</para>

      <para>The &man.lge.4; driver has been added to support the Level
      1 LXT1001 NetCellerator Gigabit Ethernet controller chip. This
      device is used on some fiber optic GigE cards from SMC, D-Link
      and Addtron.  Jumbograms and TCP/IP checksum offload on receive
      are supported, although hardware VLAN filtering is not. &merged;</para>

      <para>The &man.xl.4; driver now supports reception of VLAN
      tagged frames (on the <quote>Cyclone</quote> or newer
      chipsets). &merged;</para>

      <para>The &man.ti.4; driver correctly masks VLAN tags. &merged;</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>The IPv6 code is now based on a snapshot based on the KAME
      Project's IPv6 stack as of 28 May, 2001. &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.accept.filter.9;, a kernel feature to reduce overheads
      when accepting and reading new connections on listening sockets,
      has been added. &merged;</para>

      <para>The &man.ng.mppc.4; and &man.ng.bridge.4; node types have
      been added to the netgraph subsystem.  The &man.ng.ether.4; node
      is now dynamically loadable.  Miscellaneous bug fixes and
      enhancements have also been made. &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.netgraph.4; has received some updates and bugfixes.</para>

      <para>A new netgraph node type &man.ng.one2many.4; for multiplexing
      and demultiplexing packets over multiple links has been added.
      &merged;</para>

      <para arch="alpha">SLIP has been removed from the
      <filename>mfsroot</filename> floppy image.</para>

      <para>ICMP ECHO and TSTAMP replies are now rate limited.  TCP RSTs
      generated due to packets sent to open and unopen ports are now
      limited by separate counters.  Each rate limiting queue now has
      its own description.</para>

      <para>ICMP <literal>UNREACH_FILTER_PROHIB</literal> messages can
      now RST TCP connections in the <literal>SYN_SENT</literal> state
      if the correct sequence numbers are sent back, as controlled by the
      <varname>net.inet.tcp.icmp_may_rst</varname>
      sysctl.</para>

      <para>TCP has received some bug fixes for its delayed ACK
      behavior. &merged;</para>

      <para>TCP now supports the NewReno modification to the TCP Fast Recovery
      algorithm.  This behavior can be controlled via the
      <varname>net.inet.tcp.newreno</varname> sysctl variable. &merged;</para>

      <para>TCP now uses a more aggressive timeout for initial SYN segments; this
      allows initial connection attempts to be dropped much
      faster. &merged;</para>

      <para>The <literal>TCP_COMPAT_42</literal> kernel option has
      been removed.</para>

      <para>The <literal>TCP_RESTRICT_RST</literal> kernel option has
      been removed.  Similar functionality can be achieved with the
      <varname>net.inet.tcp.blackhole</varname> sysctl
      variable. &merged;</para>

      <para>TCP now has RFC 1323 extensions enabled by default in
      &man.rc.conf.5;. &merged;</para>

      <para>RFC 1323 and RFC 1644 TCP extensions are now disabled for a
      connection in progress if no response has been received by the
      third SYN segment sent.  This behavior tries to work around
      (very old) terminal servers with buggy VJ header compression
      implementations. &merged;</para>

      <para>The TCP implementation no longer requires the
      allocation of a TCP template structure for each connection; this
      should reduce the buffer usage on large systems handling many
      connections.</para>

      <para>A new sysctl <varname>net.inet.ip.check_interface</varname>,
      which is on by default, causes IP to verify that an incoming
      packet arrives on an interface that has an address matching the
      packet's destination address. &merged;</para>

      <para>A new sysctl
      <varname>net.link.ether.inet.log_arp_wrong_iface</varname> has
      been added to control the suppression of logging when ARP replies
      arrive on the wrong interface. &merged;</para>

      <para>The <literal>proxy</literal> modifier to &man.arp.8;'s
      <option>-d</option> option has been renamed to
      <literal>pub</literal>, for consistency with the
      <option>-s</option> option.  The <literal>only</literal> keyword
      has been added to the <option>-s</option> and
      <option>-S</option> flags, to be used in creating
      <quote>proxy-only</quote> published entries.</para>

      <para>&man.ipfw.8; now filters correctly in the presence of ECN bits in TCP
      segments. &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.ipfw.8; will now avoid the display of dynamic
      firewall rules unless the <option>-d</option> flag is passed to
      it.  The <option>-e</option> lists expired dynamic rules.</para>

      <para>&man.bridge.4; and &man.dummynet.4; have received some
      enhancements and bug fixes.</para>

      <para>&man.ipfw.8; has a new feature (<literal>me</literal>) that
      allows for packet matching on interfaces with dynamically-changing
      IP addresses. &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.ip6fw.8; now has the ability to use a preprocessor
      and use the <option>-q</option> (quiet) flag when reading from a
      file. &merged;</para>

      <para>A new <literal>options RANDOM_IP_ID</literal> kernel
      option causes the ID field of IP packets to be randomized.  This
      closes a minor information leak which allows a remote observer
      to determine the rate at which the machine is generating
      packets, since the default behaviour is to increment a counter
      for each packet sent.</para>

      <para>IP multicast now works on VLAN devices.  Several other
      bugs in the VLAN code have also been fixed.</para>

      <title>Disks and Storage</title>

      <para arch="i386">The &man.twe.4; 3ware ATA RAID driver has added. &merged;</para>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver now has support for ATA100
      controllers.  In addition, it now supports the ServerWorks ROSB4
      ATA33 chipset, the CMD 648 ATA66 and CMD 649 ATA100 chipsets, and
      the Cyrix 5530. &merged;</para>

      <para>To provide more flexible configuration, the various options for the

      <para arch="i386">The &man.asr.4; driver, which provides support
      for the Adaptec SCSI RAID controller family, as well as the DPT
      SmartRAID V and VI families, has been added. &merged;</para>

      <para arch="i386">Support for the Adaptec FSA family of PCI-SCSI
      RAID controllers has been added, in the form of the &man.aac.4;
      driver.</para>

      <para>The &man.ahc.4; driver has received numerous updates,
      bugfixes, and enhancements.  Among various improvements are
      improved compatibility with chips in <quote>RAID Port</quote> mode
      and systems with AAA and/or ARO cards installed, as well as
      performance improvements. Some bugs were also fixed, including a
      rare hang on Ultra2/U160 controllers. &merged;</para>

      <para arch="i386">The ncv, nsp, and stg drivers have
      been ported from NetBSD/pc98.  They support the NCR 53C50 /

      controllers. &merged;</para>

      <para>The &man.cd.4; driver now has support for write operations.

    ports, as well as the stock public FSF source. &merged;</para>

    <para>The threads library has gained some signal handling changes,
    bug fixes, and performance enhancements (including zero system

    <para>The &man.lastlogin.8; utility, which prints the last login
    time of each user, has been imported from
    NetBSD. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.last.1; now implements a <option>-d</option> that
    provides a <quote>snapshot</quote> of who was logged in at a
    particular date and time</para>

    <para>&man.newfs.8; now implements write combining, which can make
    creation of new filesystems up to seven times
    faster. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.newfs.8; now takes a <option>-U</option> option to
    enable softupdates on a new filesystem. &merged;</para>

    <para>The default number of cylinders per group in &man.newfs.8;
    is now 22, up from 16.</para>

    <para>A number of buffer overflows in &man.config.8; have been
    fixed. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.pwd.1; can now double as &man.realpath.1;, a program to
    resolve pathnames to their underlying physical paths. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.stty.1; now has support for an
    <literal>erase2</literal> control character, so that, for example,
    both the <keycap>Delete</keycap> and <keycap>Backspace</keycap>
    keys can be used to erase characters. &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.ibcs2.8;, &man.linux.8;, &man.osf1.8;, and &man.svr4.8;
    scripts, whose sole purpose was to load emulation
    kernel modules, have been removed.  The kernel module system will
    automatically load them as needed to fulfill dependencies.</para>

    <para>&man.top.1; will now use the full width of its tty.</para>

    <para>&man.growfs.8;, a utility for growing FFS filesystems, has
    been added.  &man.ffsinfo.8;, a utility for dump all the
    meta-information of an existing filesystem, has also been
    added.</para>

    <para>&man.indent.1; has gained some new formatting
    options. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.sysinstall.8; now uses some more intuitive defaults
    thanks to some new dialog support functions. &merged;</para>

    <para>The default root partition in &man.sysinstall.8; is now
    100MB on the i386 and 120MB on the alpha.</para>

    <para>&man.xargs.1; gained a <option>-J</option> option which allows
    the user to specify exactly where in the command line the input should
    be retrofitted. &merged;</para>

    <para>Shortly after the receipt of a <literal>SIGINFO</literal>
    signal (normally control-T from the controlling tty), &man.fsck.ffs.8;
    will now output a line indicating the current phase number and
    progress information relevant to the current phase. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.fsck.ffs.8; now supports background filesystem checks
    to mounted FFS filesystems with the <option>-B</option> option
    (softupdates must be enabled on these filesystems).  The
    <option>-F</option> flag now determines whether a specified
    filesystem needs foreground checking.</para>

    <para>&man.fsck.8; now has support for foreground
    (<option>-F</option>) and background (<option>-B</option>) checks.
    Traditionally, &man.fsck.8; is invoked before the filesystems are
    mounted and all checks are done to completion at that time.  If
    background checking is available, &man.fsck.8; is invoked twice.
    It is first invoked at the traditional time, before the
    filesystems are mounted, with the <option>-F</option> flag to do
    checking on all the filesystems that cannot do background
    checking.  It is then invoked a second time, after the system has
    completed going multiuser, with the <option>-B</option> flag to do
    checking on all the filesystems that can do background checking.
    Unlike the foreground checking, the background checking is started
    asynchronously so that other system activity can proceed even on
    the filesystems that are being checked.  Boot-time enabling of
    this feature is controlled by the
    <varname>background_fsck</varname> option in &man.rc.conf.5;.</para>

    <para>A new &man.fsck.msdosfs.8; utility has been added to check
    the consistency of MS-DOS filesystems.</para>

    install-time configuration of the &arch; <filename>boot0</filename>
    boot loader. &merged;</para>

    <para>The <option>-v</option> option to &man.rm.1; now displays
    the entire pathname of a file being removed.</para>

    <para>&man.lpr.1;, &man.lpq.1;, and &man.lpd.8; have received a
    few minor enhancements. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.lpd.8; now takes two new options:  <option>-c</option>
    will log all connection errors to &man.syslogd.8;, while
    <option>-w</option> will allow connections from non-reserved
    ports.</para>

    <para>&man.lpc.8; has been improved; <command>lpc clean</command>
    is now somewhat safer, and a new <command>lpc tclean</command>
    command has been added to check to see what files would be removed
    by <command>lpc clean</command>.</para>

    <para>If the first argument to &man.ancontrol.8; or
    &man.wicontrol.8; doesn't start with a <literal>-</literal>, it is
    assumed to be an interface.</para>

    <para>&man.rdist.1; has been retired.</para>

    <para>&man.ppp.8; has gained the <literal>tcpmssfixup</literal>
    option, which adjusts outgoing TCP SYN packets so that the maximum
    receive segment size is no larger than allowed by the interface
    MTU.</para>

    <para><filename>libcrypt</filename> and
    <filename>libdescrypt</filename> have been unified to provide a
    configurable password authentication hash library.  Both the md5
    and des hash methods are provided unless the des hash is
    specifically compiled out.</para>

    <para>&man.passwd.1; and &man.pw.8; now select the password hash
    algorithm at run time.  See the <literal>passwd_format</literal>
    attribute in <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename>.</para>

    <para>In preparation for meeting SUSv2/POSIX
    <filename>&lt;sys/select.h&gt;</filename> requirements,

    moved to <filename>&lt;sys/selinfo.h&gt;</filename>.</para>

    <para>&man.syslogd.8; now supports a <literal>LOG_CONSOLE</literal>
    facility (disabled by
    default), which can be used to log <filename>/dev/console</filename> 
    output. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.rpcgen.1; now uses <filename>/usr/bin/cpp</filename>
    (as on NetBSD), not <filename>/usr/libexec/cpp</filename>.</para>

    <para>Boot-time &man.syscons.4; configuration was moved to a
    machine-independent <filename>/etc/rc.syscons</filename>. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.burncd.8; now supports a <option>-m</option> option for
    multisession mode (the default behavior now is to close disks as

    image files from a filename was also added; <filename>-</filename>
    can be used as a filename for <literal>stdin</literal>. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.dmesg.8; now has a <option>-a</option> option to show
    the entire message buffer, including &man.syslogd.8; records and

    <para>&man.cdcontrol.1; now uses the <literal>CDROM</literal>
    environment variable to pick a default device. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.cdcontrol.1; now supports <literal>next</literal> and
    <literal>prev</literal> commands to skip forwards or backwards a
    specified number of tracks while playing an audio CD.</para>

    <para>&man.sysctl.8; now supports a <option>-N</option> option to
    print out variable names only.</para>

    <para>&man.sysctl.8; has replaced the <option>-A</option> and
    <option>-X</option> options with <option>-ao</option> and
    <option>-ax</option> respectively; the former options are now
    deprecated.  The <option>-w</option> is deprecated as well; it is
    not needed to determine the user's intentions.</para>

    <para>&man.sysinstall.8; now lives in <filename>/usr/sbin</filename>,
    which simplifies the installation process.  The &man.sysinstall.8;
    manpage is also installed in a more consistent fashion now.</para>

    <para>&man.config.8; is now better about converting various 
    warnings that should
    have been errors into actual fatal errors with an exit code.  This
    ensures that <literal>make buildkernel</literal> 
    doesn't quietly ignore them and
    build a bogus kernel without a human to read the errors. &merged;</para>

    <para><filename>libc</filename> is now thread-safe by default;
    <filename>libc_r</filename> contains only thread functions.</para>

    primaries for regular-expression matches.  The <option>-E</option>
    flag now enables extended regular expressions. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.find.1; now has the <option>-anewer</option>,
    <option>-cnewer</option>, <option>-mnewer</option>,

    primaries for comparisons of file timestamps. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.tftpd.8; now takes the <option>-c</option> and
    <option>-C</option> options, which allow the server to
    &man.chroot.2; based on the IP address of the connecting client.
    &man.tftp.1; and &man.tftpd.8; can now transfer files larger than
    65535 blocks. &merged;</para>

    with the <option>-i</option> flag. &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.rfork.thread.3; library call has been added as a
    helper function to &man.rfork.2;.  Using this function should
    avoid the need to implement complex stack swap
    code. &merged;</para>

    <para>Significant additions have been made to internationalization
    support; &os; now has complete locale support for the
    <literal>LC_MONETARY</literal>, <literal>LC_NUMERIC</literal>, and

    applications have been updated to take advantage of this
    support.</para>

    <para>Locale names have been changed to improve compatability with
    the names used by X11R6, as well as a number of other UNIX
    versions.  As an example, the <literal>en_US.ISO_8859-1</literal>
    locale name has been changed to
    <literal>en_US.ISO8859-1</literal>.  Entries in
    <filename>/etc/locale.alias</filename> provide backward
    compatability.</para>

    <para>A <filename>compat4x</filename> distribution has been added
    for compatibility with &os; 4-STABLE.</para>

    <para>The

        <title>OpenSSH</title>

	<para><application>OpenSSH</application> has been upgraded to
	2.1.0, which provides support for the SSH2 protocol, including DSA
	keys.  Therefore, <application>OpenSSH</application> users in the
	US no longer need to rely on the restrictively-licensed
	RSAREF toolkit which is required to
	handle RSA keys.  <application>OpenSSH</application> 2.1 interoperates well with other SSH2
	clients and servers, including the <filename>ssh2</filename> port.
	See the <ulink url="http://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH Web
	site</ulink> for more details. &merged;</para>

	<para><application>OpenSSH</application> can now authenticate

	in SSH2 mode. &merged;</para>

	<para><application>OpenSSH</application> has been upgraded to
	2.2.0.  &man.ssh-add.1; and &man.ssh-agent.1; can now handle DSA
	keys.  A server for sftp, interoperable with ssh.com
	clients and others has been added.  &man.scp.1; can now handle
	files larger than 2 GBytes.  Interoperability with other SSH2
	clients/servers has been improved.  A new feature to limit the
	number of outstanding unauthenticated ssh connections in
	&man.sshd.8; has been added. &merged;</para>

	<para><application>OpenSSH</application> has been upgraded to
	2.3.0.  This version adds support for the Rijndael encryption
	algorithm. &merged;</para>

        <para><application>PAM</application> support for
        <application>OpenSSH</application> has been added.</para>

	<para>A long-standing bug in <application>OpenSSH</application>,
	which sometimes resulted in a dropped session when an

	<para><application>Kerberos</application> compatability has been
	added to <application>OpenSSH</application>. &merged;</para>

	<para><application>OpenSSH</application> has been modified to be
	more resistant to traffic analysis by requiring that

	null packet, as well as by padding passwords sent so as not to
	hint at password lengths. &merged;</para>

        <para>&man.sshd.8; is now enabled by default on new
        installs. &merged;</para>

        <para>&man.sshd.8; <literal>X11Forwarding</literal> is now turned

        is already disabled by default).</para>

	<para>In <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename>, the

	<title>sendmail</title>

	<para><application>sendmail</application> has been upgraded from

	default file locations (see
	<filename>/usr/src/contrib/sendmail/cf/README</filename>);
	&man.newaliases.1; is limited to <username>root</username> and
	trusted users; STARTTLS encryption; and the MSA port (587) is
	turned on by default.  See
	<filename>/usr/src/contrib/sendmail/RELEASE_NOTES</filename> for
	more information. &merged;</para>

	<para>&man.mail.local.8; is no longer installed as a SUID binary.
	If you are using a <filename>/etc/mail/sendmail.cf</filename> from
	the default <filename>sendmail.cf</filename> included with &os;
	any time after 3.1.0, you are fine.  If you are using a
	hand-configured <filename>sendmail.cf</filename> and
	<command>mail.local</command> for delivery, check to make sure the
	<literal>F=S</literal> flag is set on the
	<literal>Mlocal</literal> line.  Those with
	<filename>.mc</filename> files who need to add the flag can do so
	by adding the following line to their <filename>.mc</filename>
	file and regenerating the <filename>sendmail.cf</filename>
	file:</para>

      <title>Ports/Packages Collection</title>

      <para>Version numbers of installed packages have a new
      (backward-compatible) syntax, which supports the
      <varname>PORTREVISION</varname> and <varname>PORTEPOCH</varname>
      variables in Ports Collection <filename>Makefile</filename>s.
      These changes help keep track of changes in the ports collection
      entries such as security patches or &os;-specific updates, which
      aren't reflected in the original, third-party software
      distributions.  &man.pkg.version.1; can now compare these
      new-style version numbers. &merged;</para>

      <para>To improve performance and disk utilization, the <quote>ports
      skeletons</quote> in the FreeBSD Ports Collection have been restructured.
      Installed ports and packages should not be affected. &merged;</para>

      <para>All packages and ports now contain an <quote>origin</quote>
      directive, which makes it easier for programs such as
      &man.pkg.version.1; to determine the directory from which a
      package was built. &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.pkg.update.1;, a utility to update installed packages
      and update their dependencies, has been added. &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.pkg.info.1; now supports globbing against names of
      installed packages.  The <option>-G</option> option disables this
      behavior, and the <option>-x</option> option causes regular
      expression matching instead of shell globbing. &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.pkg.info.1; can now accept a <option>-g</option> flag for
      verifying an installed package against its recorded checksums (to
      see if it's been modified post-installation).  Naturally, this
      mechanism is only as secure as the contents of
      <filename>/var/db/pkg</filename> if it's to be used for auditing
      purposes. &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.pkg.create.1; and &man.pkg.add.1; can now work with
      packages that have been compressed using
      &man.bzip2.1;. &man.pkg.add.1; will use the PACKAGEROOT
      environment variable to determine a mirror site for new
      packages. &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.pkg.create.1; now records dependencies in dependency
      order rather than in the order specified on the command line.
      This improves the functioning of <command>pkg_add
      -r</command>. &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.pkg.version.1; now has a version number comparison
      routine that corresponds to the Porters Handbook.  It also has a
      <option>-t</option> option for testing address comparisons. 
      &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.pkg.version.1; now takes a <option>-s</option> flag
      to limit its operation to ports/packages matching a given
      string. &merged;</para>

      <para>When requested to delete multiple packages,
      &man.pkg.delete.1; will now attempt to remove them in dependency
      order rather than the order specified on the command
      line. &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.pkg.delete.1; now can perform glob/regexp matching of
      package names.  In addition, it supports a <option>-a</option>
      option for removing all packages and a <option>-i</option> option
      for &man.rm.1;-style interactive confirmation. &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.pkg.sign.1; and &man.pkg.check.1; have been added to
      digitally sign and verify the signatures on binary package
      files. &merged;</para>

      <para><application>BSDPAN</application>, a collection of modules
      that provides tighter integration of
      <application>Perl</application> into the &os; Ports
      Collection, has been added.</para>
