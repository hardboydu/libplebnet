  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.  Some
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
    url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.  More
    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink

  <para>Users who are new to the &release.branch; series of &os;
    &release.type;s should also read the <quote>Early Adopters Guide
    to &os; &release.current;</quote>.  This document can generally be
    found in the same location as the release notes (either as a part of a
    &os; distribution or on the &os; Web site).  It contains important
    information regarding the advantages and disadvantages of using
    &os; &release.current;, as opposed to releases based on the &os;
    4-STABLE development branch.</para>

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
<![ %include.historic; [
      the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
      since &release.prev;.
      In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
      branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.
]]>
<![ %no.include.historic; [
      many of the user-visible new or changed features in &os;
      since &release.prev;.  It includes items that are unique to the
      &release.branch; branch, as well as some features that may have been
      recently merged to
      other branches (after &os; &release.prev.historic;).  The latter
      items are marked as &merged;.

  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev.historic;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>A remotely exploitable vulnerability in
      <application>CVS</application> has been corrected with the
      import of version 1.11.5.  More details can be found in security
      advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:01.cvs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:01</ulink>.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>A timing-based attack on <application>OpenSSL</application>,
      which could allow a very powerful attacker access to plaintext
      under certain circumstances, has been prevented via an upgrade
      to <application>OpenSSL</application> 0.9.7.  See security
      advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:02.openssl.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:02</ulink>
      for more details. &merged;</para>

    <para>The security and performance of the
      <quote>syncookies</quote> feature has been improved to decrease
      the chance of an attacker being able to spoof connections.
      More details are given in security advisory <ulink

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para arch="pc98">Support for the CanBe power management
      controller has been added. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.devfs.5; is now mandatory; the
      <literal>NODEVFS</literal> option has been removed from the set of
      possible kernel configuration options.</para>

    <para arch="i386,pc98">The DRM kernel modules have been updated to
      a snapshot from the DRI CVS repository, roughly equivalent to
      XFree86 4.3.0 but also including some additional
      bug fixes.</para>

    <para arch="i386,ia64,pc98">An ehci driver has been added; it supports
      the USB Enhanced Host Controller Interface used by USB 2.0
      controllers.</para>

    <para>A minor bug in the permissions handling of
      <filename>/dev/tty</filename> has been fixed.  As a result,
      &man.ssh.1; can now be used after &man.su.1;.</para>

    <para>A bug that caused &man.fstat.2; to return
      <literal>0</literal> as the number of bytes available to read
      from a TCP socket has been fixed.</para>

    <para>A bug that caused &man.kqueue.2; to report
      <literal>0</literal> as the number of bytes available to read
      from a TCP socket has been fixed.  The
      <literal>NOTE_LOWAT</literal> flag for
      <literal>EVFILT_READ</literal> has been fixed.</para>

    <para>Linux emulation mode now supports IPv6.</para>

    <para>&man.madvise.2; now supports a
      <literal>MADV_PROTECT</literal> behavior, which informs the
      virtual memory system that a process is critical and should not
      be killed when swap space has been exhausted.  The process must
      be owned by the superuser.</para>

    <para arch="i386,pc98">The tw driver for TW-523 power line
      interfaces (used by X-10 home control products) has been
      removed.  It is currently non-functional, and would require a
      considerable amount of work to make it work under
      &release.branch;.  The xten and xtend userland control programs
      have also been removed.</para>

    <!-- Above this line, sort kernel changes by manpage/keyword-->

    <para>A second process scheduler, designed to be a general purpose
      scheduler with many SMP benefits, has been added to the scheduler
      framework.  Exactly one scheduler must be specified in a kernel
      configuration.  The original scheduler may be selected using
      <literal>options&nbsp;SCHED_4BSD</literal>.  The newer
      (experimental) scheduler can be selected by using
      <literal>options&nbsp;SCHED_ULE</literal>.</para>

    <para>Device major numbers are now allocated dynamically by
      default.  This change greatly decreases the need for a static,
      centralized table of major number assignments to device drivers
      (a few drivers retain their old static major numbers for
      compatibility), and also reduces the possibility of running out
      of device major numbers.</para>

    <para arch="i386,pc98">A partial lazy switch mechanism for
      in-kernel threads has been implemented; it is designed to reduce
      the overhead of short context switches (such as for interrupt
      handlers) that do not involve another process.  This feature can
      be enabled with
      <literal>options&nbsp;LAZY_SWITCH</literal>.</para>

    <sect3 id="proc">
      <title>Processor/Motherboard Support</title>

      <para arch="i386"><literal>SMP</literal> kernels now have
	rudimentary support for HyperThreading (HTT).  The scheduler
	treats the logical CPUs as if they were additional physical
	CPUs.  This can actually cause suboptimal performance in some
	cases due to contention for resources.  Therefore, logical
	CPUs are halted by default at startup.  They can be enabled
	with the <varname>machdep.hlt_logical_cpus</varname> sysctl
	variable.  It is also possible to halt any CPU in the idle
	loop with the <varname>machdep.hlt_cpus</varname> sysctl
	variable.  The &man.smp.4; manual page has more details.

	<note>
	  <para>Some other versions of &os;, including early
	    5.0-CURRENT snapshots and 4.8-RELEASE, used
	    <literal>options&nbsp;HTT</literal> to enable
	    HyperThreading support at kernel configuration time.  This
	    option is no longer necessary.</para>
	</note>

	</para>

      <para arch="i386">Support for the Physical Address Extensions
	(PAE) capability on Intel Pentium Pro and higher processors
	has been added.  This allows the use of up to 64GB of RAM in a
	machine, although the amount of memory usable by any single
	process (or the &os; kernel) is unchanged.  For more
	information, see the &man.pae.4; manual page.  Work on this
	feature was sponsored by DARPA and Network Associates
	Laboratories.</para>

      <para arch="i386">A new &man.vpd.4; driver has been added to
        read hardware information from the Vital Product Data structure
        on IBM ThinkPad machines.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="boot">
      <title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

      <para arch="alpha">The alpha boot loader
        (<filename>boot1</filename>) can now be called
        <filename>boot</filename> for consistency with other
        platforms.</para>

      <para arch="i386,pc98">The two parts of the boot loader
        (<filename>boot1</filename> and <filename>boot2</filename>)
        have been combined into a single <filename>boot</filename>
        file, to simplify programs that need to write or otherwise
        manipulate the boot loader.</para>

      <para arch="pc98">The PC98 boot loader now has support for
        booting from SCSI MO media. &merged;</para>

      <para>The <filename>/modules</filename> directory (once the
        default location for modules on &os; 4.<replaceable>X</replaceable>) is no longer a
        part of the default <varname>kern.module_path</varname>.
        Third-party modules should be placed in
        <filename>/boot/modules</filename>.

	<note>
	  <para>Modules designed for use with &os; 4.<replaceable>X</replaceable> are likely to
	    panic when loaded into a &os; &release.current; kernel and should be used with extreme caution.</para>
	</note>
      </para>

      <para arch="i386">Due to code size limitations, the i386 boot
        loader can only load kernels from root file systems that are
        1.5TB or smaller in size.</para>

      <!-- Above this line, order boot loader changes by keyword-->

    <sect3 id="net-if">
      <title>Network Interface Support</title>

      <para arch="i386,pc98">A new &man.axe.4; network driver has been
	added.  It provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on
	the ASIX Electronics AX88172 USB 2.0 chipset.</para>

      <para>The cm driver now supports IPX. &merged;</para>

      <para arch="i386">The &man.sbsh.4; driver for the Granch SBNI16
        SHDSL modem has been added. &merged;</para>

      <para>A new &man.wlan.4; module provides 802.11 link-layer support.  The
	&man.wi.4; and &man.an.4; drivers now use this facility.</para>

      <para arch="i386,alpha,pc98,sparc64">A timing bug in the
	&man.xl.4; driver, which could cause a kernel panic (or other
	problems) when configuring an interface, has been
	fixed.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="net-proto">
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>&man.ipfw.4; <literal>skipto</literal> rules can once
        again be used with the <literal>log</literal> keyword.
	&man.ipfw.4; <literal>uid</literal> rules are once again
        working.</para>

      <para>It is now possible to build the
        <literal>FAST_IPSEC</literal> and <literal>INET6</literal>
        options into the same kernel.  (They still cannot be used
        together, however.)</para>

      <para>A bug in TCP NewReno, which caused premature exit from
	fast recovery when NewReno was enabled, has been
	fixed. &merged;</para>

      <para>TCP now has support for the <quote>Limited
	Transmit</quote> mechanism proposed by RFC 3042.  This feature
	is intended to improve the effectiveness of TCP loss recovery
	in certain circumstances.  It is off by default but can be
	enabled with the <varname>net.inet.tcp.rfc3042</varname>
	sysctl variable.  More information can be found in
	&man.tcp.4;.</para>

      <para>TCP now has support for increased initial congestion
	window sizes as described in RFC 3390.  This feature can
	improve the throughput of short transfers, as well as
	high-bandwidth, large propagation-delay connections.  It is
	off by default but can be enabled with the
	<varname>net.inet.tcp.rfc3390</varname> sysctl variable.  More
	information can be found in &man.tcp.4;.</para>

      <para>The IP fragment reassembly code behaves more gracefully
	when receiving a large number of packet fragments (it is
	designed to be more resistant to fragment-based denial of
	service attacks). &merged;</para>

      <para>TCP connections in the <literal>TIME_WAIT</literal> state
	now use a special protocol control block that uses less space
	than a full-blown TCP PCB.  This allows some of the data
	structures and resources used by such a connection to be freed
	earlier.</para>

      <para>It is now possible to specify the range of
        <quote>privileged ports</quote> (TCP and UDP ports that
        require superuser access to &man.bind.2; to).  The range is
        now specified with the
        <varname>net.inet.ip.portrange.reservedlow</varname> and
        <varname>net.inet.ip.portrange.reservedhigh</varname> sysctl
        variables, defaulting to the traditional UNIX behavior.  This
        feature is intended to help network servers bind
        to traditionally privileged ports without requiring superuser
        access.  &man.ip.4; has more details.</para>

      <para>Some bugs in the non-blocking RPC code has been fixed.  As
	a result, &man.amd.8; users are now able to mount volumes from
	a &release.current; server.</para>

      <para>Support for XNS networking, which has not worked
	correctly for almost seven years, has been removed.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="disks">
      <title>Disks and Storage</title>

      <para>The &man.aac.4; driver now runs free of the Giant kernel
        lock.  This change has given a nearly 20% performance speedup
        on an SMP system running multiple I/O intensive loads.</para>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver now supports all known SiS
	chipsets.  (More details can be found in the Hardware
	Notes.)</para>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver now supports the Promise SATA150
	TX2 and TX4 Serial ATA/150 controllers.</para>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver now flushes devices on shutdown.
	This change may result in failure messages being printed on
	the console for devices that do not support flushing.</para>

      <para>The CAM layer now has support for devices with more than
	2<superscript>32</superscript> blocks.  (Assuming 512-byte
	blocks, this means support for devices larger than 2TB.)

	<note>
	  <para>For users upgrading across this change, note that all
	    userland applications that talk to &man.pass.4; or
	    &man.xpt.4; devices must be recompiled.  Examples of such
	    programs are &man.camcontrol.8; in the base system,

	</para>

      <para>A number of changes have been made to the &man.cd.4;
        driver.  The primary user-visible change is improved
        compatibility with ATAPI/USB/Firewire CDROM drives.</para>

      <para>&man.geom.4; is now mandatory; the
        <literal>NO_GEOM</literal> has been removed from the set of
        kernel configuration options.</para>

      <para>The &man.iir.4; driver has been updated; this update is

        installation.</para>

      <para>A bug in the &man.mly.4; driver that caused hangs has been
	corrected.</para>

      <para>Support has been added for volume labels on UFS and UFS2
        file systems.  These labels are strings that can be used to
        identify a volume, regardless of what device it appears on.
        Labels can be set with the <option>-L</option> options to
        &man.newfs.8; or &man.tunefs.8;.  With the

      specify an alternate <filename>.netrc</filename> file.</para>

    <para>&man.fetch.3; now has support for
      <filename>.netrc</filename> files (see &man.ftp.1; for more
      details).</para>

    <para>&man.ftpd.8; now supports a <option>-h</option> option to
      disable printing any host-specific information, such as the
      &man.ftpd.8; version or hostname, in server messages.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.ftpd.8; now supports a <option>-P</option> option to
      specify a port on which to listen in daemon mode.  The default
      data port number is now set to be one less than the control port
      number, rather than being hard-coded. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.ftpd.8; now supports an extended format of the
      <filename>/etc/ftpchroot</filename> file.  Please refer
      to the &man.ftpchroot.5; manpage, which is now available,
      for details. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.ftpd.8; now supports login directory pathnames
      that specify simultaneously a directory for &man.chroot.2;
      and that to change to in the chrooted environment.  The
      <literal>/./</literal> separator is used for
      this purpose, like in other FTP daemons having this feature.
      It may be used in both &man.ftpchroot.5; and &man.passwd.5;.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.fwcontrol.8; now supports <option>-R</option> and
      <option>-S</option> options for receiving and sending DV
      streams. &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.gstat.8; utility has been added to show the disk
      activity inside the &man.geom.4; subsystem.</para>

    <para>&man.ipfw.8; now supports <literal>enable</literal> and
      <literal>disable</literal> commands to control various aspects
      of the operation of &man.ipfw.4; (including enabling and
      disabling the firewall itself).  These provide a more convenient
      and visible interface than the existing sysctl
      variables. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.jail.8; now supports a <option>-i</option> flag to
      output an identifier for a newly-created jail.</para>

    <para>The &man.jexec.8; utility has been added to execute a
      command inside an existing jail.</para>

    <para>The &man.jls.8; utility has been added to list existing
      jails.</para>

    <para>&man.kenv.1; has been moved from
      <filename>/usr/bin</filename> to <filename>/bin</filename> to
      make it available at times during system startup when only the
      root file system is mounted.</para>

    <para>&man.killall.1; now supports a <option>-j</option> option to
      kill all processes inside a jail.</para>

    <para>The &man.libgeom.3; library has been added to allow some
      userland access to the &man.geom.4; subsystem.</para>

    <para>The mac_portacl MAC policy module has been added.  It
      provides a simple ACL mechanism to permit users and groups to
      bind ports for TCP or UDP, and is intended to be used in
      conjunction with the recently-added
      <varname>net.inet.ip.portrange.reservedhigh</varname> sysctl.</para>

    <para>The <filename>MAKEDEV</filename> script is now unnecessary, due to the mandatory
      presence of &man.devfs.5;, and has been removed.</para>

    <para>&man.mergemaster.8; now supports a <option>-P</option>
      option to preserve the contents of files being replaced.</para>

    <para>&man.mixer.8; can now implement relative volume
      adjustments.</para>

    <para>The &man.mksnap.ffs.8; program has been added to allow
      easier creation of FFS snapshots.  It is a
      SUID-<username>root</username> executable designed for use by
      members of the <groupname>operator</groupname> group.</para>

    <para>&man.mount.8; and &man.umount.8; now accept a
      <option>-F</option> option to specify an alternate &man.fstab.5;
      file.</para>

    <para>&man.mount.nfs.8; now supports a <option>-c</option> flag to
      avoid doing a &man.connect.2; for UDP mount points.  This option
      must be used if the server does not reply to requests from the
      standard NFS port number 2049 or if it replies to requests using
      a different IP address (which can occur if the server is
      multi-homed).  Setting the
      <varname>vfs.nfs.nfs_ip_paranoia</varname> sysctl to
      <literal>0</literal> will make this option the
      default. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.mount.nfs.8; now supports the <option>noinet4</option>
      and <option>noinet6</option> mount options to prevent NFS mounts
      from using IPv4 or IPv6 respectively.</para>

    <para>&man.newfs.8; will now create UFS2 file systems by default,
      unless UFS1 is specifically requested with the
      <option>-O1</option> option.</para>

    <para>&man.newsyslog.8; now supports a <literal>W</literal> flag
      to force previously-started compression jobs for an entry (or
      group of entries specified with the <literal>G</literal> flag)
      to finish before beginning a new one.  This feature is designed
      to prevent system overloads caused by starting several
      compression jobs on big files simultaneously. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.nsdispatch.3; is now thread-safe and implements support
      for Name Service Switch (NSS) modules.  NSS modules may be
      statically built into <filename>libc</filename> or dynamically
      loaded via &man.dlopen.3;.  They are loaded/initialized at
      configuration time (i.e. when &man.nsdispatch.3; is called and
      &man.nsswitch.conf.5; is read or re-read).</para>

    <para>A new &man.pam.chroot.8; module has been added, which does a
      &man.chroot.2; operation for users into either a predetermined
      directory or one derived from their home directory.</para>

    <para>&man.pam.ssh.8; has been rewritten.  One side effect of the
      rewrite is that it now starts a separate instance of
      &man.ssh-agent.1; for each session instead of trying to connect
      each session to the agent started by the first session.</para>

    <para>&man.ping.8; now supports a <option>-D</option> flag to set
      the <quote>Don't Fragment</quote> bit on outgoing packets.</para>

    <para>&man.ping.8; now supports a <option>-M</option> option to use
      ICMP mask request or timestamp request messages instead of ICMP
      echo requests.</para>

    <para>&man.ping.8; now supports a <option>-z</option> flag to set
      the Type of Service bits in outgoing packets.</para>

    <para>&man.pw.8; can now add a user whose name ends with a
      <literal>$</literal> character; this change is intended to help
      administration of <application>Samba</application>
      services. &merged;</para>

    <para>A bug in &man.rand.3; that could cause a sequence to remain
      stuck at <literal>0</literal> has been fixed.  (&man.rand.3;
      remains unsuitable for all but trivial uses.)</para>

    <para>&man.rtld.1; now has support for the dynamic mapping of
      shared object dependencies.  This optional feature is especially
      useful when experimenting with different threading libraries.
      It is not, however, built by default.  More information on
      enabling and using this feature can be found in
      &man.libmap.conf.5;.</para>

    <para>&man.sem.open.3; now correctly handles multiple opens of the
      same semaphore; as a result, &man.sem.close.3; no longer crashes
      calling programs.</para>

    <para>The seeding algorithm used by &man.srandom.3; has been
      strengthened.</para>

    <para arch="sparc64">The sunlabel utility, a program analogous to
      &man.disklabel.8; that works on Sun disk labels, has been
      added.</para>

    <para arch="i386,alpha,sparc64,ia64">&man.sysinstall.8; will now
      select UFS2 as the default layout for new file systems unless
      specifically requested in the disk labeler.

      <note arch="i386">
	<para>Due to i386 boot loader limitations, the root file system
	must be 1.5TB or smaller in size.</para>
      </note>

      </para>

    <para>The &man.swapoff.8; command has been added to disable paging
      and swapping on a device.  A related &man.swapctl.8; command has
      been added to provide an interface to &man.swapon.8; and
      &man.swapoff.8; similar to other BSDs.

      <note>
        <para>The &man.swapoff.8; feature should be considered
	  experimental.</para>
      </note>
    </para>

    <para>&man.syslogd.8; now allows multiple hosts or programs to be
      named in host or program specifications in &man.syslog.conf.5;
      files.</para>

    <para>&man.systat.1; now includes an <option>-ifstat</option>
      display mode that displays the network traffic going through
      active interfaces on the system.</para>

    <para>The &man.usbhidaction.1; command has been added; it performs
      actions according to its configuration in response to USB HID
      controls.</para>

    <para>&man.uudecode.1; and &man.b64decode.1; now support a
      <option>-r</option> flag for decoding raw (or broken) files that
      may be missing the initial and possibly final framing
      lines. &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.vmstat.8; has re-implemented the <option>-f</option>
      flag, which displays statistics on fork operations.</para>

    <para>&man.xargs.1; now supports a <option>-P</option> option to
      execute multiple copies of the same utility in parallel.</para>

    <para>&man.xargs.1; now supports a <option>-o</option> flag to
      reopen <filename>/dev/tty</filename> for the child process
      before executing the command.  This is useful when the child
      process is an interactive application.</para>

    <para>A 1:1 threading package (where for every pthread in an
      application there is one KSE and thread) has been implemented.
      Under this model, the kernel handles all thread scheduling
      decisions and all signal delivery.  This uses some of the common
      KSE code, and is a restricted case of the M:N threading work
      still in progress.  The <filename>libthr</filename> library
      implementing the userland portion of this functionality is a
      drop-in replacement for the <filename>libc_r</filename> library.
      Note that <filename>libthr</filename> is not (at this time)
      built by default.</para>

    <para>The historic BSD boot scripts in <filename>/etc</filename>
      have been removed, in favor of the <filename>rc.d</filename>
      system imported from <application>NetBSD</application>
      (sometimes referred to as <quote>rcNG</quote>).  All
      functionality of the historic system has been preserved.  In
      particular, files such as <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>
      continue to be the recommended means of configuring the system
      startup.  The <filename>rc.d</filename> system has been the
      default since &os; 5.0-RELEASE, so this change should be largely
      transparent for the vast majority of users.  Users who have
      customized their historic-style startup scripts should be aware
      that the following files have been removed from
      <filename>/etc</filename>:

      <filename>rc.atm</filename>,
      <filename>rc.devfs</filename>,
      <filename>rc.diskless1</filename>,
      <filename>rc.diskless2</filename>,
      <filename>rc.i386</filename>,
      <filename>rc.alpha</filename>,
      <filename>rc.amd64</filename>,
      <filename>rc.ia64</filename>,
      <filename>rc.sparc64</filename>,
      <filename>rc.isdn</filename>,
      <filename>rc.network</filename>,
      <filename>rc.network6</filename>,
      <filename>rc.pccard</filename>,
      <filename>rc.serial</filename>,
      <filename>rc.syscons</filename>,
      <filename>rc.sysctl</filename>.

      &man.mergemaster.8;, when run, will offer to move these files
      out of the way for convenience.  More details can be found in
      &man.rc.subr.8;.</para>
