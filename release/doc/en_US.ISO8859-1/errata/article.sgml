	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <ulink
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>, plus any sites
      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of

    <para>The implementation of the &man.realpath.3; function contains
      a single-byte buffer overflow bug.  This may have various
      impacts, depending on the application using &man.realpath.3; and
      other factors.  This bug was fixed on the &release.branch; development
      branch before &release.prev;; &os; &release.prev; is therefore not affected.  However, this change
      was not noted in the release documentation.  For
      more information, see security advisory

    <para>The RAIDframe disk driver described in &man.raid.4; is
      non-functional for this release.</para>

    <para>ACPI seems to make some i386 machines unstable.  Turning off
      ACPI support may help solve some of these problems; see an item
      in <xref linkend="late-news">.</para>

    <para>An integer overflow could cause kernel panics on PAE-using
      machines with certain memory sizes.  This bug has been corrected
      on both the <literal>RELENG_5_1</literal> and
      <literal>HEAD</literal> branches.  A workaround for this problem
      is to remove some memory, update the system in question, and
      reinstall the memory.</para>

    <para>Attempting to write to an &man.msdosfs.5; file system that
      has been upgraded from read-only to read-write via
      <command>mount -u</command> will cause the system to lock up.
      To work around this problem, unmount the file system first, then
      mount it again with the appropriate options instead of using
      <command>mount -u</command>.</para>

    <para>&man.ipfw.4; should work correctly on strict-alignment
      64-bit architectures such as alpha and sparc64.</para>

    <para>The release notes should have stated that the
      <filename>libthr</filename> library is built by default for the
      i386 platform.</para>

    <para>&os; &release.prev; includes some new boot loader scripts
      designed to make booting &os; with different options easier.
      This may help diagnose bootstrapping problems.  These scripts
      build on the existing Forth-based boot loader scripts (thus,
      <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> and other existing loader
      configuration files still apply).  They are only installed by
      default for new binary installs on i386 machines.  The new
      scripts present a boot-time menu that controls how &os; is
      booted, and include options to turn off ACPI, a <quote>safe
      mode</quote> boot, single-user booting, and verbose booting.
      <quote>Safe mode</quote> booting can be particularly useful when
      compatibility with a system's hardware is uncertain, and sets
      the following kernel tunable variables:</para>

      <programlisting>hint.acpi.0.disabled=1 # disable ACPI (i386 only)
hw.ata.ata_dma=0       # disable IDE DMA
hw.ata.atapi_dma=0     # disable ATAPI/IDE DMA
hw.ata.wc=0            # disable IDE disk write cache
hw.eisa_slots=0        # disable probing for EISA devices</programlisting>

    <para>For new installs on i386 architecture machines,
      &man.sysinstall.8; will try to determine if ACPI was disabled
      via the new boot loader scripts mentioned above, and if so,
      ask if this change should be made permanent.</para>

    <para>The release notes should have mentioned that work on the
      following features was sponsored by the Defense Advanced
      Research Projects Agency (DARPA): OpenPAM, NSS support, PAE
      support, various MAC framework updates, the GEOM disk geometry
      system.</para>
