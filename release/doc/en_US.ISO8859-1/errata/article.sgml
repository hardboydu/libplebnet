<!-- 
	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <para>This document lists errata that pertain to the most
    recently-released version of &os; (&release.current;).  It includes
    both security advisories that pertain this release, as well as
    items relating to the software or documentation, discovered after
    the release, that could affect its operation or usability.

    <note>
      <para>At this time, &release.current; has no errata, because
      there have not been any releases on the &release.branch;
      branch since the last branchpoint.  (The first such release will
      be &release.next;.)
      This file exists to provide a clean template for
      newly-created branches.  (Clearly this notice should not exist
      on any branched version of this file.)</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>If you read no other documentation before installing this
    version of &os;, you should <emphasis>read
    the errata</emphasis> for this release so that you don't stumble
    over problems which have already been found and fixed.  Any
    version of this
    <filename>ERRATA.TXT</filename> file actually distributed with the
    release is out of
    date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the net and
    should be consulted as the <quote>current errata</quote> for your
    release.  These other copies of the errata are located at <ulink
    url="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/">http://www.freebsd.org/releases/</ulink>,
    as well as any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this
    location).</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &release.current; also
    contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the
    snapshot).</para>

    <para>Any changes to this file are also automatically emailed to the
    &a.current;.</para>
