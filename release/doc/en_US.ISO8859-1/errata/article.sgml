<!-- 
	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <para>This document lists errata items for &os; 
    &release.current;, containing significant information
    discovered after the release.  This information includes 
    security advisories, as well as
    news relating to the software or documentation
    that could affect its operation or usability.  An up-to-date
    version of this document should always be consulted before
    installing this version of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [
    <para>This errata document for &os; &release.prev; will be
    maintained until the release of &os; &release.next;.</para>
]]>

<![ %release.type.release [
    <para>This is the final version of the errata document for &os; &release.prev;.  Future errata documents along the 
    &release.branch; branch will address &os; &release.current; and
    later releases.</para>
]]>

      <para>At this time, &release.current; has no errata, because
      there have not been any releases on the &release.branch;
      branch since the last branchpoint.  (The first such release will
      be &release.next;.)
      This file exists to provide a clean template for
      newly-created branches.  (Clearly this notice should not exist
      on any branched version of this file.)</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>
    about &os; &release.current;.  Before installing this version,
    it is important to consult this document to learn about
    any post-release discoveries or 
    problems that may already have been found and
    fixed.</para>

    <para>Any
    version of this
    errata document actually distributed with the
    release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of
    date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and
    should be consulted as the <quote>current errata</quote> for this
    release.  These other copies of the errata are located at <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>,
    plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this
    location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
    contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the
    snapshot).</para>
