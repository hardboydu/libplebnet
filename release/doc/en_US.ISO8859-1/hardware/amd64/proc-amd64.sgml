  <title>Supported Processors and Motherboards</title>

  <para>&os;/&arch; has supported the &arch.print;
    (<quote>Hammer</quote>) architecture since mid-2003.  It made its
    first debut as an experimental release based on &os;
    5.1-RELEASE.</para>

  <para>As of this writing, this port supports the Athlon64
    (<quote>Clawhammer</quote>) and Opteron
    (<quote>Sledgehammer</quote>) machines.  The largest tested
    memory configuration to date is 8GB.  There is no support for SMP
    machines at present.</para>

  <para>In many respects, &os;/&arch; is similar to &os;/i386, in
    terms of drivers supported.  There may be some issues with 64-bit
    cleanliness in some (particularly older) drivers.  Generally,
    drivers that already function correctly on other 64-bit platforms
    should work.</para>

  <para>&os;/&arch; is still very much a work in progress.  Much work
    is being done in the &os; Perforce repository and then merged to
    the &os; CVS repository as it stabilizes.</para>
