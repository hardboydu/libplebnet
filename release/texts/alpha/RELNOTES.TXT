                            FreeBSD Release 5.0-SNAP

This is a 5.0-CURRENT release SNAPshot of FreeBSD, an active
development branch which will produce its first release in early
March 2001.  Those features which have also been back-ported to
the 4.x-stable branch (the next release for which will be 4.2)
are marked [MERGED].

Any installation failures or crashes should be reported by using the
send-pr command (those preferring a Web-based interface can also see
http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html).

For information about FreeBSD and the layout of the 5.0-RELEASE
directory (especially if you're installing from floppies!), see
ABOUT.TXT.  For installation instructions, see the INSTALL.TXT and
HARDWARE.TXT files.

For the latest of these 5.0-current snapshots, you should always see:

1. What's new since the 4.0/5.0 branch
--------------------------------------
All changes described here are unique to the 5.0 branch unless
specifically marked as [MERGED] features.


1.1. KERNEL CHANGES
-------------------

A new event notification facility called kqueue was added to the
FreeBSD kernel.  This is a new interface which is able to replace
poll/select, offering improved performance, as well as the ability
to report many different types of events.  Support for monitoring
changes in sockets, pipes, fifos, and files are present, as well as
for signals and processes. [MERGED]
   
Support for named extended attributes was added to the FreeBSD kernel.
This allows the kernel, and appropriately privileged userland processes,
to tag files and directories with attribute data.  Extended attributes
were added to support the TrustedBSD Project, in particular ACLs, 
capability data, and mandatory access control labels.  

POSIX.1b Shared Memory Objects are now supported.  The implementation
uses regular files, but automatically enables the MAP_NOSYNC flag
when they are mmap(2)ed. [MERGED]

Added support for PCI ethernet adapters based on the National Semiconductor
DP83815 chipset, including the NetGear FA312-TX.

Due to a licensing change, softupdates have been integrated into the
main portion of the kernel source tree.  As a consequence, softupdates   
are now available with the GENERIC kernel. [MERGED]

ipfilter has been updated to 3.4.9. 

The tap driver, a virtual Ethernet device driver for bridged 
configurations, has been added.  [MERGED]

accept_filters, a kernel feature to reduce overheads when accepting
and reading new connections on listening sockets, has been added.
[MERGED]

The ata(4) driver now has support for ATA100 controllers. [MERGED]
In addition, it now supports the ServerWorks ROSB4 ATA33 chipset,
the CMD 648 ATA66 and CMD 649 ATA100 chipsets, and the Cyrix 5530.

The ata(4) driver now has support for tagged queueing, which is
enabled by the ATA_ENABLE_TAGS option.

AlphaServer 1200 ("Tincup") has been tested and works OK. Currently it does
not want to boot from CD or floppy but a transplanted disk that was
installed on another Alpha works well. [MERGED]

The ti(4) driver now supports the Alteon AceNIC 1000baseT Gigabit
Ethernet and Netgear GA620T 1000baseT Gigabit cards. [MERGED]

SMP support has been largely reworked, incorporating code from BSD/OS
5.0.

The boot loader has been updated.  The new default kernel is now 
/boot/kernel/kernel.  The new default module location is 
/boot/kernel/.

A filesystem snapshot capability has been added to FFS.  Details can 
be found in /usr/src/sys/ufs/ffs/README.snapshot.

The ng_mppc(4) and ng_bridge(4) node types have been added to the
netgraph subsystem.  The ng_ether(4) node is now dynamically loadable.
Miscellaneous bug fixes and enhancements have also been made. [MERGED]

The pcn(4) driver, which supports the AMD PCnet/FAST, PCnet/FAST+,
PCnet/PRO, PCnet/Home, and HomePNA adapters, has been added.  Although
these cards are already supported by the lnc(4) driver, the pcn driver
runs these chips in 32-bit mode and uses the RX alignment feature to
achieve zero-copy receive.  This driver is also machine-independent,
so it will work on both the i386 and alpha platforms.  The lnc driver
is still needed to support non-PCI cards. [MERGED]

The ed(4) driver is now also supported on the Alpha.


1.2. SECURITY FIXES
-------------------

rlogind(8), rshd(8), and fingerd(8) are now disabled by default in
/etc/inetd.conf.  This only affects new installations.  [MERGED]


1.3. USERLAND CHANGES
---------------------

cdcontrol(1) now supports a "cdid" command, which calculates and
displays the CD serial number, using the same algorithm used by the CDDB
database. [MERGED]

mtree(8) now includes support for a file listing pathnames to be excluded
when creating and verifying prototypes.  This makes it easier to use
mtree as a part of an intrusion-detection system.  [MERGED]

OpenSSL has been upgraded to 0.9.5a, which includes numerous bugfixes
and enhancements. [MERGED]

The OPIE one-time-password suite has been updated to 2.32. [MERGED]

OpenSSH has been upgraded to 2.1.0, which provides support for the
SSH2 protocol, including DSA keys.  Therefore, OpenSSH users in the US
no longer need to rely on the restrictively-licensed RSAREF toolkit
which is required to handle RSA keys.  OpenSSH 2.1 interoperates well
with other SSH2 clients and servers, including the ssh2 port.  See
http://www.openssh.com for more details. [MERGED]

OpenSSH can now authenticate using OPIE passwords in SSH1 mode.
Support is not yet available in SSH2 mode. [MERGED]

OpenSSH has been upgraded to 2.2.0.  ssh-add(1) and ssh-agent(1) can now
handle DSA keys.  An sftp server interoperable with ssh.com clients
and others has been added.  scp(1) can now handle files >2GB.
Interoperability with other ssh2 clients/servers has been improved.  A
new feature to limit the number of outstanding unauthenticated ssh
connections in sshd has been added.

Support for USB devices was added to the GENERIC kernel and to the
installation programs to support USB devices out of the box.  Note that
SRM does not support USB devices at the moment, so you must still use
an AT keyboard if you are not using a serial console. [MERGED]

The csh(1) shell has been replaced by tcsh(1), although it can still
be run as csh(1). [MERGED]

The more(1) command has been replaced by less(1), although it can still
be run as more(1). [MERGED]

ls(1) can produce colorized listings with the -G flag (and appropriate
terminal support). [MERGED]

sendmail upgraded from version 8.9.3 to version 8.11.1.  Important changes
include: new default file locations (see
/usr/src/contrib/sendmail/cf/README); newaliases is limited to root and
trusted users; and the MSA port (587) is turned on by default.  See
/usr/src/contrib/sendmail/RELEASE_NOTES for more information. [MERGED]

awk has been upgraded from gawk-3.0.4 to gawk-3.0.6.  This fixes a number
of non-critical bugs and includes a few performance tweaks.

routed(8) has been updated to version 2.22.  [MERGED]

The truncate(1) utility, which truncates or extends the length
of files, has been added.  [MERGED]

syslogd(8) can take a -n option to disable DNS queries for every
request. [MERGED]

kenv(1), a command to dump the kernel environment, has been added. 
[MERGED]

The behavior of periodic(8) is now controlled by /etc/defaults/periodic.conf
and /etc/periodic.conf. [MERGED]

logger(1) can now send messages directly to a remote syslog. [MERGED]

which(1) is now a C program, rather than a Perl script.

killall(1) is now a C program, rather than a Perl script.  As a
result, killall's -m option now uses the regular expression syntax of
regex(3), rather than that of perl(1). [MERGED]

finger(1) now has the ability to support fingering aliases, via the
finger.conf(5) file. [MERGED]

nsswitch support has been merged from NetBSD.  By creating an 
nsswitch.conf(5) file, FreeBSD can be configured so that various 
databases such as passwd(5) and group(5) can be looked up using flat 
files, NIS, or Hesiod.  The old hosts.conf(5) file is no longer used.

sshd X11Forwarding is now turned on by default on server (any risk is
to the client, where it is already disabled by default).

RSA Security has waived all patent rights to the RSA algorithm (two
weeks before the patent was due to expire).  As a result, the native
OpenSSL implementation of the RSA algorithm is now activated by
default, and the rsaref port and librsaUSA are no longer
required for USA residents. [MERGED]

sshd now enabled by default on new installs. [MERGED]

perl has been updated to version 5.6.0.

Binutils have been upgraded to 2.10.0. [MERGED]

libreadline has been upgraded to 4.1. [MERGED]

The ifconfig(8) command can set the link-layer address of an interface. 
[MERGED]

bktr(4) driver update to 2.1.5.  New tuner types have been added, 
and improvememts to the KLD module and to memory allocation have been
made. [MERGED]

setproctitle(3) has been moved from libutil to libc. [MERGED]

chio(1) now has the ability to specify elements by volume tag instead
of by their physical location as well as the ability to return an
element to its previous location.

sed(1) now takes a -E option for extended regular expression
support. [MERGED]

ln(1) now takes an -i option to request user configuration before
overwriting an existing file. [MERGED]

Version numbers of installed packages have a new (backward-compatible)
syntax, which supports the "PORTREVISION" and "PORTEPOCH" variables in
ports collection makefiles.  These changes help keep track of changes
in the ports collection entries such as security patches or
FreeBSD-specific updates, which aren't reflected in the original,
third-party software distributions.  pkg_version(1) can now compare
these new-style version numbers.  [MERGED]

cvs(1) has been updated to 1.11.

3. Obtaining FreeBSD
--------------------

You may obtain FreeBSD in a variety of ways:

3.1. FTP/Mail
-------------

You can ftp FreeBSD and any or all of its optional packages from
`ftp.FreeBSD.org' - the official FreeBSD release site.

For other locations that mirror the FreeBSD software see the file
MIRROR.SITES.  Please ftp the distribution from the site closest (in
networking terms) to you.  Additional mirror sites are always welcome!
Contact freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org for more details if you'd like to 
become an official mirror site.

If you do not have access to the Internet and electronic mail is your
only recourse, then you may still fetch the files by sending mail to
`ftpmail@ftpmail.vix.com' - putting the keyword "help" in your message
to get more information on how to fetch files using this mechanism.
Please do note, however, that this will end up sending many *tens of
megabytes* through the mail and should only be employed as an absolute
LAST resort!


3.2. CDROM
----------

FreeBSD 4.x-RELEASE and 3.x-RELEASE CDs may be ordered on CDROM from:

        Walnut Creek CDROM

4. Upgrading from previous releases of FreeBSD
----------------------------------------------

If you're upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD, most likely
it's 3.0 and there may be some issues affecting you, depending
of course on your chosen method of upgrading.  There are two popular
ways of upgrading FreeBSD distributions:

        o Using sources, via /usr/src
        o Using sysinstall's (binary) upgrade option.

Please read the UPGRADE.TXT file for more information, preferably
before beginning an upgrade.


5. Reporting problems, making suggestions, submitting code.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Your suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are always
valued - please do not hesitate to report any problems you may find
(preferably with a fix attached, if you can!).

The preferred method to submit bug reports from a machine with
Internet mail connectivity is to use the send-pr command or use the CGI
script at http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html.  Bug reports
will be dutifully filed by our faithful bugfiler program and you can
be sure that we'll do our best to respond to all reported bugs as soon
as possible.  Bugs filed in this way are also visible on our WEB site
in the support section and are therefore valuable both as bug reports
and as "signposts" for other users concerning potential problems to
watch out for.

If, for some reason, you are unable to use the send-pr command to
submit a bug report, you can try to send it to:

                freebsd-bugs@FreeBSD.org

Note that send-pr itself is a shell script that should be easy to move
even onto a totally different system.  We much prefer if you could use
this interface, since it make it easier to keep track of the problem
reports.  However, before submitting, please try to make sure whether
the problem might have already been fixed since.


Otherwise, for any questions or tech support issues, please send mail to:

                freebsd-questions@FreeBSD.org


If you're tracking the -current development efforts, you should
definitely join the -current mailing list, in order to keep abreast
of recent developments and changes that may affect the way you
use and maintain the system:

		freebsd-current@FreeBSD.org


Additionally, being a volunteer effort, we are always happy to have
extra hands willing to help - there are already far more desired
enhancements than we'll ever be able to manage by ourselves!  To
contact us on technical matters, or with offers of help, please send
mail to:

                freebsd-hackers@FreeBSD.org


Please note that these mailing lists can experience *significant*
amounts of traffic and if you have slow or expensive mail access and
are only interested in keeping up with significant FreeBSD events, you
may find it preferable to subscribe instead to:

                freebsd-announce@FreeBSD.org


All of the mailing lists can be freely joined by anyone wishing
to do so.  Send mail to MajorDomo@FreeBSD.org and include the keyword
`help' on a line by itself somewhere in the body of the message.  This
will give you more information on joining the various lists, accessing
archives, etc.  There are a number of mailing lists targeted at
special interest groups not mentioned here, so send mail to majordomo
and ask about them!
