$FreeBSD$

The release notes and other documentation files formerly in this
directory are now rendered from SGML as part of the release build.
ASCII text versions appear on the floppy images (as before), while
both ASCII and HTML versions are included in the CDROM and FTP
directory trees.

Snapshots of the release documentation files for both FreeBSD -CURRENT
and 4-STABLE are (for now) available at:

http://people.freebsd.org/~bmah/relnotes/

Eventually, these files will be integrated into the main FreeBSD Web
site as a part of the Web site build.

For more information, please see ../doc/README.

If you are a committer wishing to add a release note entry or
otherwise wishing to update the release documentation, please edit the
SGML files under ../doc/ or send a message to freebsd-doc@freebsd.org
with a plain-text submission.
