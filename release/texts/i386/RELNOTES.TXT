1. What's new since the 4.0/5.0 branch
--------------------------------------
All changes described here are unique to the 5.0 branch unless
specifically marked as [MERGED] features.


1.1. KERNEL CHANGES
-------------------

A new event notification facility called kqueue was added to the
FreeBSD kernel.  This is a new interface which is able to replace
poll/select, offering improved performance, as well as the ability
to report many different types of events.  Support for monitoring
changes in sockets, pipes, fifos, and files are present, as well as
for signals and processes. [MERGED]

Support for named extended attributes was added to the FreeBSD kernel.
This allows the kernel, and appropriately privileged userland processes,
to tag files and directories with attribute data.  Extended attributes
were added to support the TrustedBSD Project, in particular ACLs,
capability data, and mandatory access control labels.

Support for Intel's Wired for Management 2.0 (PXE) was added to
the FreeBSD boot loader.  Due to API differences, the older PXE
versions are not supported.  This allow network booting using DHCP. [MERGED]

POSIX.1b Shared Memory Objects are now supported.  The implementation
uses regular files, but automatically enables the MAP_NOSYNC flag
when they are mmap(2)ed. [MERGED]

Added support for PCI Ethernet adapters based on the National Semiconductor
DP83815 chipset, including the NetGear FA312-TX.

Due to a licensing change, softupdates have been integrated into the
main portion of the kernel source tree.  As a consequence, softupdates
are now available with the GENERIC kernel. [MERGED]

A driver for AGP hardware has been added. [MERGED]

ipfilter has been updated to 3.4.16. [MERGED]

Various fixes and improvements to the IPv6 code have been merged in
from the KAME project, including significantly-improved IPSEC
functionality. [MERGED]

twe 3ware ATA RAID driver added. [MERGED]

The tap driver, a virtual Ethernet device driver for bridged
configurations, has been added.  [MERGED]

accept_filters, a kernel feature to reduce overheads when accepting
and reading new connections on listening sockets, has been added.
[MERGED]

The ata(4) driver now has support for ATA100 controllers.  In
addition, it now supports the ServerWorks ROSB4 ATA33 chipset, the CMD
648 ATA66 and CMD 649 ATA100 chipsets, and the Cyrix 5530. [MERGED]

The ata(4) driver now has support for tagged queuing, which is
enabled by the ATA_ENABLE_TAGS option. [MERGED]

The ata(4) driver now has support for ATA "pseudo" RAID controllers as
the Promise Fasttrak and HighPoint HPT370 controllers. [MERGED]

The ti(4) driver now supports the Alteon AceNIC 1000baseT Gigabit
Ethernet and Netgear GA620T 1000baseT Gigabit cards. [MERGED]

The mly(4) driver, for Mylex PCI to SCSI AccelRAID and eXtremeRAID
controllers with firmware 6.x and later, has been added. [MERGED]

The asr(4) driver, which provides support for the Adaptec SCSI RAID
controller family, as well as the DPT SmartRAID V and VI families, has
been added. [MERGED]

SMP support has been largely reworked, incorporating code from BSD/OS
5.0.  One of the main features of SMPng ("SMP Next Generation") is to
allow more processes to run in kernel, without the need for spin locks
that can dramatically reduce the efficiency of multiple processors.
Interrupt handlers now have contexts associated with them that allow
them to be blocked, which reduces the need to lock out interrupts.

The xl(4) driver now supports the 3Com 3C556 and 3C556B MiniPCI
adapters used on some laptops. [MERGED]

The kernel and modules have been moved to the directory /boot/kernel,
so they can be easily manipulated together.  The boot loader has been
updated to make this change as seamless as possible.

A filesystem snapshot capability has been added to FFS.  Details can
be found in /usr/src/sys/ufs/ffs/README.snapshot.

Support for the Adaptec FSA family of PCI-SCSI RAID controllers has
been added, in the form of the aac(4) driver. [MERGED]

The ng_mppc(4) and ng_bridge(4) node types have been added to the
netgraph subsystem.  The ng_ether(4) node is now dynamically loadable.
Miscellaneous bug fixes and enhancements have also been made. [MERGED]

The pcn(4) driver, which supports the AMD PCnet/FAST, PCnet/FAST+,
PCnet/FAST III, PCnet/PRO, PCnet/Home, and HomePNA adapters, has been added.
Although these cards are already supported by the lnc(4) driver, the pcn
driver runs these chips in 32-bit mode and uses the RX alignment feature to
achieve zero-copy receive.  This driver is also machine-independent,
so it will work on both the i386 and alpha platforms.  The lnc driver
is still needed to support non-PCI cards. [MERGED]

A bug in the ed(4) driver that could cause panics with very short
packets and BPF or bridging active has been fixed. [MERGED]

The i386 boot loader now has support for a "nullconsole" console type,
for use on systems with neither a video console nor a serial
port. [MERGED]

The pcm(4) driver now supports the ESS Solo 1, Maestro-1, Maestro-2,
and Maestro-2e; Forte Media fm801, ESS Maestro-2e, and VIA
Technologies VT82C686A sound card/chipsets, and has received some
other updates. [MERGED] A driver for the ESS Maestro-3/Allegro has
been added, however due to the amount of GPL firmware included, it
will only be built as a module.  Separate drivers for the SoundBlaster
8 and Soundblaster 16 now replace an older, unified driver.
A driver for the CMedia CMI8338/CMI8738 sound chips has been added.
A driver for the CS4281 sound chip has been added. [MERGED]

Replace the PQ_*CACHE options with a single PQ_CACHESIZE option to be
set to the cache size in kilobytes.  The old options are still
supported for backwards compatibility. [MERGED]

The NCPU, NAPIC, NBUS, and NIN kernel configuration options,
for configuring SMP kernels, have been removed.  NCPU is now set to a
maximum of 16, and the other, aforementioned options are now dynamic.
[MERGED]

The ahc(4) driver has been updated.  Among various improvements are
improved compatability with chips in "RAID Port" mode and systems with
AAA and ARO cards installed, as well as performance
improvements. [MERGED]

ACPI support has been merged in from the FreeBSD-ACPI project.

isdn4bsd has been updated to version 0.96.00

The ihfc(4) driver for supporting Cologne Chip Designs HFC devices
under isdn4bsd has been added.

The itjc(4) driver for supporting NETjet-S / Teles PCI-TJ under
isdn4bsd has been added.

Experimental support for the Eicon.Diehl DIVA 2.0 and 2.02 ISA PnP
ISDN cards has been added to the isic(4) isdn4bsd driver.

Support for Fujitsu MB86960A/MB86965A based Ethernet PC-Cards is back.
[MERGED]

devfs(5), which allows entries in the /dev directory to be built
automatically and supports more flexible attachment of devices, has
been largely reworked.  devfs(5) is configured into the GENERIC
kernel.

Preliminary Cardbus support under NEWCARD has been added.  This supports
TI113X, TI12XX, TI125X, Ricoh 5C46/5C47, Topic 95/97/100 and
Cirrus Logic PD683X bridges.  16-bit PC Card support under this is not yet
functional.

Write combining for crashdumps has been implemented.  This feature
is useful when write caching is disabled on both SCSI and IDE disks,
where large memory dumps could take up to an hour to complete. [MERGED]

The bktr(4) driver has been updated to 2.15.  New tuner types have
been added, and improvements to the KLD module and to memory
allocation have been made. [MERGED]

The bktr(4) driver has been updated to 2.17.  This fixes bugs in devfs
when unloading and reloading, and syncs with some NetBSD
changes. [MERGED]

The bktr(4) driver has been updated to 2.18.  This adds support for
new Hauppauge Model 44xxx WinTV Cards (the ones with no audio mux).

Extremely large swap areas (>67 GB) no longer panic the system.

The snc(4) driver for the National Semiconductor DP8393X (SONIC)
Ethernet controller.  Currently, this driver is only used on the PC-98
architecture. [MERGED]

The ich(4) driver for the Intel 82801AA (ICH) SMBus controller and
compatibles has been added. [MERGED]

The Inode Filesystem (IFS) has been added; more information can be
found in /usr/src/sys/ufs/ifs/README.

The uscanner(4) driver for basic USB scanner support using SANE. See
the SANE home page for supported scanners. HP ScanJet 4100C, 5200C
and 6300C are known to be working.

The umodem(4) driver for USB modems. Supported so far is only the
3Com 5605 and Metricom Ricochet GS wireless USB modems.

The ncv, nsp, and stg drivers have been ported from NetBSD/pc98.
They supports NCR 53C50 / Workbit Ninja SCSI-3 / TMC 18C30, 18C50
based PC-Card/ISA SCSI controllers. [MERGED]

The cd(4) driver now has support for write operations.  This allows
writing to DVD-RAM, PD and similar drives that probe as CD devices.
Note that change affects only random-access writeable devices, not
sequential-only writeable devices such as CD-R drives, which are
supported by cdrecord. [MERGED]

The ISO-9660 filesystem now has a hook that supports a loadable
character conversion routine.  The sysutils/cd9660_unicode port
contains a set of common conversions. [MERGED]

The an(4) driver for Cisco Aironet cards now supports Wired Equivalent
Privacy (WEP) encryption, settable via ancontrol(8). [MERGED]

The pcm(4) audio driver is now compiled into the GENERIC kernel by
default.

The pccard driver and pccardc(8) now support multiple "beep types"
upon card insertion and removal. [MERGED]

The spic(4) driver, which provides access to the jog dial device on
some Sony laptops, has been added.

A new netgraph node type ng_one2many(4) for multiplexing and
demultiplexing packets over multiple links has been added.  [MERGED]

Softupdates for FFS have received some bug fixes and enhancements.

A number of cleanups and enhancements have been applied to the PCI
subsystem.  /usr/share/misc/pci_vendors now contains a vendor/device
database, which can be used by pciconf(8).

netgraph(4) has received some updates.

sbufs, null-terminated string data structures, and their associated
support routines, have been added to the kernel.  Details are in
sbuf(9).

The el(4) driver can now be loaded as a module.

The vinum(4) volume manager has received some bug fixes and enhancements.

ICMP ECHO and TSTAMP replies are now rate limited.  TCP RSTs generated
due to packets sent to open and unopen ports are now limited by
separate counters.  Each rate limiting queue now has its own
description.

ICMP UNREACH_FILTER_PROHIB messages can now RST TCP connections in the
SYN_SENT state if the correct sequence numbers are sent back, as
controlled by the net.inet.tcp.icmp_may_rst sysctl. [MERGED]

TCP has received some bug fixes for its delayed ACK behavior. [MERGED]

TCP now supports the NewReno modification to the TCP Fast Recovery
algorithm.  This behavior can be controlled via the
net.inet.tcp.newreno sysctl variable. [MERGED]

TCP now uses a more aggressive timeout for initial SYN segments; this
allows initial connection attempts to be dropped much faster. [MERGED]

A new sysctl net.inet.ip.check_interface, which is on by default,
causes IP to verify that an incoming packet arrives on an interface
that has an address matching the packet's destination address. [MERGED]

PECOFF (WIN32 Execution file format) support has been added.

kernfs(5) is obsolete and has been retired.

md(4), the memory disk device, has had the functionality of vn(4)
incorporated into it.  md(4) devices can now be configured by
mdconfig(8).

The ray(4) driver, which supports the Webgear Aviator wireless network
cards, has been committed.  The operation of ray(4) interfaces can be
modified by raycontrol(8).  [MERGED]

Linksys Fast Ethernet PCCARD cards supported by the ed(4) driver now
require the addition of flag 0x80000 to their config line in
pccard.conf(5).  This flag is not optional.  These Linksys cards will
not be recognized without it. [MERGED]

A new API has been added for sound cards with hardware volume
control.

The VESA S3 linear framebuffer driver has been added.

A new sysctl 'net.link.ether.inet.log_arp_wrong_iface' to controls the
suppression of logging when ARP replies arrive on the wrong
interface. [MERGED]

A bug in the NFS client that caused bogus access times with
O_EXCL|O_CREAT opens was fixed.  [MERGED]

Support for the 80386 processor has been removed from the GENERIC
kernel, as this code seriously pessimizes performance on other ia32
processors.

The I386_CPU kernel option to support the 80386 processor is now mutually
exclusive with support for other ia32 processors; this should slightly
improve performance on the 80386 due to the elimination of runtime
processor type checks.

Custom kernels that will run on the 80386 can still be built by changing
the cpu options in the kernel configuration file to only include I386_CPU.

Condition variables have now been implemented in the FreeBSD kernel.
See condvar(9) for more details.

A bug in FFS that could cause superblock corruption on very large
filesystems has been corrected. [MERGED]

The "make buildkernel" target now gets the name of the
configuration(s) to build from the KERNCONF variable, not KERNEL.  It
is no longer required, in some cases, for a "buildworld" to precede a
"buildkernel".  (The buildworld is still required when upgrading across
major releases, across binutil upgrades and when config changes
version.)

bridge(4) and dummynet(4) have received some enhancements and bug fixes.

ipfw(8) has a new feature ("me") that allows for packet matching on
interfaces with dynamically-changing IP addresses. [MERGED]

The isp(4) driver has been updated. [MERGED]

The ida disk driver now has crashdump support. [MERGED]

The random(4) device has been rewritten to use the Yarrow algorithm.
It harvests entropy from a variety of interrupt sources, including the
console devices, Ethernet and point-to-point network interfaces, and
mass-storage devices.  Entropy from the random(4) device is now
periodically saved to files in /var/db/entropy.


1.2. SECURITY FIXES
-------------------

sysinstall(8) now allows the user to select one of three "security
profiles" at install-time.  These profiles enable different levels of
system security by enabling or disabling various system services in
rc.conf(5) on new installs. [MERGED]

A bug in which malformed ELF executable images can hang the system has
been fixed (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-00:41). [MERGED]

A security hole in Linux emulation was fixed (see security advisory
FreeBSD-SA-00:42).  [MERGED]

rlogind(8), rshd(8), and fingerd(8) are now disabled by default in
/etc/inetd.conf.  This only affects new installations.  [MERGED]

String-handling library calls in many programs were fixed to reduce the
possibility of buffer overflow-related exploits.  [MERGED]

TCP now uses stronger randomness in choosing its initial sequence
numbers (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-00:52). [MERGED]

Several buffer overflows in tcpdump(1) were corrected (see security
advisory FreeBSD-SA-00:61).  [MERGED]

A security hole in top(1) was corrected (see security advisory
FreeBSD-SA-00:62). [MERGED]

A potential security hole caused by an off-by-one-error in
gethostbyname(3) has been fixed (see security advisory
FreeBSD-SA-00:63).  [MERGED]

A potential buffer overflow in the ncurses(3X) library, which could
cause arbitrary code to be run from within systat(1), has been corrected
(see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-00:68).  [MERGED]

A vulnerability in telnetd(8) that could cause it to consume large
amounts of server resources has been fixed (see security advisory
FreeBSD-SA-00:69).  [MERGED]

The "nat deny_incoming" command in ppp(8) now works correctly (see
security advisory FreeBSD-SA-00:70).  [MERGED]

A vulnerability in csh(1)/tcsh(1) temporary files that could allow
overwriting of arbitrary user-writable files has been closed (see
security advisory FreeBSD-SA-00:76). [MERGED]

The ssh(1) binary is no longer SUID root by default.

Some fixes were applied to the Kerberos IV implementation related to
environment variables, a possible buffer overrun, and overwriting
ticket files. [MERGED]

telnet(1) now does a better job of sanitizing its environment. [MERGED]

Several vulnerabilities in procfs(4) were fixed (see security advisory
FreeBSD-SA-00:77).  [MERGED]

A bug in OpenSSH in which a server was unable to disable ssh-agent or
X11 forwarding was fixed (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:01).
[MERGED]

A bug in ipfw(8) and ipfw6(8) in which inbound TCP segments could
incorrectly be treated as being part of an "established" connection
has been fixed (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:08).  [MERGED]

A bug in crontab(8) that could allow users to read any file on the
system in valid crontab(5) syntax has been fixed (see security
advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:09).  [MERGED]

A vulnerability in inetd(8) that could allow read-access to the
initial 16 bytes of wheel-accessible files has been fixed (see
security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:11). [MERGED]

A bug in periodic(8) that used insecure temporary files has been
corrected (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:12). [MERGED]

A bug in sort(1) in which an attacker might be able to cause it to
abort processing has been fixed (see security advisory
FreeBSD-SA-01:13). [MERGED]

To fix a remotely-exploitable buffer overflow, BIND has been updated
to 8.2.3 (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:18). [MERGED]

OpenSSH now has code to prevent (instead of just mitigating through
connection limits) an attack that can lead to guessing the server key
(not host key) by regenerating the server key when an RSA failure is
detected (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:24). [MERGED]

A number of programs have had output formatting strings corrected so
as to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities. [MERGED]

A number of programs that use temporary files now do so more
securely. [MERGED]

A bug in ICMP that could cause an attacker to disrupt TCP and UDP
"sessions" has been corrected. [MERGED]


1.3. USERLAND CHANGES
---------------------

cdcontrol(1) now supports a "cdid" command, which calculates and
displays the CD serial number, using the same algorithm used by the CDDB
database. [MERGED]

mtree(8) now includes support for a file listing pathnames to be excluded
when creating and verifying prototypes.  This makes it easier to use
mtree as a part of an intrusion-detection system.  [MERGED]

OpenSSL has been upgraded to 0.9.6. [MERGED]

OpenSSL now has support for machine-dependent ASM optimizations,
activated by the new MACHINE_CPU Makefile variable.

The OPIE one-time-password suite has been updated to 2.32. [MERGED]

OpenSSH has been upgraded to 2.1.0, which provides support for the
SSH2 protocol, including DSA keys.  Therefore, OpenSSH users in the US
no longer need to rely on the restrictively-licensed RSAREF toolkit
which is required to handle RSA keys.  OpenSSH 2.1 interoperates well
with other SSH2 clients and servers, including the ssh2 port.  See
http://www.openssh.com for more details. [MERGED]

OpenSSH can now authenticate using OPIE passwords in SSH1 mode.
Support is not yet available in SSH2 mode. [MERGED]

OpenSSH has been upgraded to 2.2.0.  ssh-add(1) and ssh-agent(1) can now
handle DSA keys.  An sftp server interoperable with ssh.com clients
and others has been added.  scp(1) can now handle files >2GB.
Interoperability with other ssh2 clients/servers has been improved.  A
new feature to limit the number of outstanding unauthenticated ssh
connections in sshd has been added. [MERGED]

OpenSSH has been upgraded to 2.3.0.  This version adds support for the
Rijndael encryption algorithm. [MERGED]

PAM support for OpenSSH has been added.

A long-standing bug in SSH, which sometimes resulted in a dropped
session when an X11-forwarded client was closed, was fixed.

Support for USB devices was added to the GENERIC kernel and to the
installation programs to support USB devices out of the box.  Note that
an AT keyboard must still be used during the initial install, but it
should work fine afterwards. [MERGED]

The entire i386 bootstrap was revamped to support automatic detection and
use of the Enhanced Disk Drive BIOS extensions to support booting beyond
the 1023rd cylinder.  As part of this change, the FreeBSD boot manager
(boot0) was increased from 1 sector in size (512 bytes), to 2 sectors in
length (1024 bytes).  As a result, several userland changes were made to
cope with MBR boot loaders of varying sizes. [MERGED]

The csh(1) shell has been replaced by tcsh(1), although it can still
be run as csh(1). [MERGED]  tcsh has been updated to version 6.10.

The more(1) command has been replaced by less(1), although it can still
be run as more(1). [MERGED]

ls(1) can produce colorized listings with the -G flag (and appropriate
terminal support). [MERGED]

libalias(3) and natd(8) now support RFC 2391 (Load Sharing using IP
Network Address Translation), as well as new translation options.
[MERGED]

FreeBSD can now be installed over an IPv6-only network. [MERGED]

sendmail upgraded from version 8.9.3 to version 8.11.3.  Important changes
include: new default file locations (see
/usr/src/contrib/sendmail/cf/README); newaliases is limited to root and
trusted users; STARTTLS encryption; and the MSA port (587) is turned on by
default.  See /usr/src/contrib/sendmail/RELEASE_NOTES for more
information. [MERGED]

mail.local(8) is no longer installed as a set-user-id binary.  If you are
using a /etc/mail/sendmail.cf from the default sendmail.cf included with
FreeBSD any time after 3.1.0, you are fine.  If you are using a
hand-configured sendmail.cf and mail.local for delivery, check to make sure
the F=S flag is set on the Mlocal line.  Those with .mc files who need to
add the flag can do so by adding the following line to their your .mc file
and regenerating the sendmail.cf file:
    MODIFY_MAILER_FLAGS(`LOCAL', `+S')dnl
Note that FEATURE(`local_lmtp') already does this. [MERGED]

The default /etc/mail/sendmail.cf disables the SMTP EXPN and VRFY
commands. [MERGED]

vacation(1) has been updated to use the version included with
sendmail. [MERGED]

The sendmail(8) configuration building tools are installed in
/usr/share/sendmail/cf/. [MERGED]

New make.conf options: SENDMAIL_MC and SENDMAIL_ADDITIONAL_MC.  See
/etc/defaults/make.conf for more information.  [MERGED]

The Makefile in /etc/mail now supports: the new SENDMAIL_MC make.conf
option; the ability to build .cf files from .mc files; generalized map
rebuilding; rebuilding the aliases file; and the ability to stop, start,
and restart sendmail.  [MERGED]

sysinstall(8) now properly preserves /etc/mail during a binary
upgrade. [MERGED]

awk has been upgraded from gawk-3.0.4 to gawk-3.0.6.  This fixes a number
of non-critical bugs and includes a few performance tweaks. [MERGED]

routed(8) has been updated to version 2.22. [MERGED]

The truncate(1) utility, which truncates or extends the length
of files, has been added.  [MERGED]

syslogd(8) can take a -n option to disable DNS queries for every
request. [MERGED]

kenv(1), a command to dump the kernel environment, has been added.
[MERGED]

The behavior of periodic(8) is now controlled by /etc/defaults/periodic.conf
and /etc/periodic.conf. [MERGED]

boot98cfg(8), a PC-98 boot manager installation and configuration
utility, has been added. [MERGED]

logger(1) can now send messages directly to a remote syslog. [MERGED]

GDB now supports hardware watchpoints (using the kernel's debug register
support that has been introduced in FreeBSD 4.0). [MERGED]

which(1) is now a C program, rather than a Perl script.

killall(1) is now a C program, rather than a Perl script.  As a
result, killall's -m option now uses the regular expression syntax of
regex(3), rather than that of perl(1). [MERGED]

killall(1) now allows non-root users to kill SUID root processes that
they started.

finger(1) now has the ability to support fingering aliases, via the
finger.conf(5) file. [MERGED]

finger(1) now has support for a .pubkey file.

nsswitch support has been merged from NetBSD.  By creating an
nsswitch.conf(5) file, FreeBSD can be configured so that various
databases such as passwd(5) and group(5) can be looked up using flat
files, NIS, or Hesiod.  The old hosts.conf(5) file is no longer used.

sshd X11Forwarding is now turned on by default on server (any risk is
to the client, where it is already disabled by default).

RSA Security has waived all patent rights to the RSA algorithm (two
weeks before the patent was due to expire).  As a result, the native
OpenSSL implementation of the RSA algorithm is now activated by
default, and the rsaref port and librsaUSA are no longer
required for USA residents. [MERGED]

sshd is now enabled by default on new installs. [MERGED]

perl has been updated to version 5.6.0.

Binutils have been upgraded to 2.10.1. [MERGED]

libreadline has been upgraded to 4.1. [MERGED]

The ifconfig(8) command can set the link-layer address of an interface.
[MERGED]

setproctitle(3) has been moved from libutil to libc. [MERGED]

chio(1) now has the ability to specify elements by volume tag instead
of by their physical location as well as the ability to return an
element to its previous location. [MERGED]

sed(1) now takes a -E option for extended regular expression
support. [MERGED]

ln(1) now takes an -i option to request user confirmation before
overwriting an existing file. [MERGED]

Version numbers of installed packages have a new (backward-compatible)
syntax, which supports the "PORTREVISION" and "PORTEPOCH" variables in
ports collection makefiles.  These changes help keep track of changes
in the ports collection entries such as security patches or
FreeBSD-specific updates, which aren't reflected in the original,
third-party software distributions.  pkg_version(1) can now compare
these new-style version numbers.  [MERGED]

cvs(1) has been updated to 1.11. [MERGED]

tcpdump(1) has received some updates and bug fixes. [MERGED]

User-land ppp(8) has received a number of updates and bug fixes. [MERGED]

To improve performance and disk utilization, the "ports skeletons" in
the FreeBSD Ports Collection have been restructured.  Installed ports
and packages should not be affected. [MERGED]

make(1) has gained the :C/// (regexp substitution), :L (lowercase),
and :U (uppercase) variable modifiers.  These were added to reduce the
differences between the FreeBSD and OpenBSD/NetBSD make programs. [MERGED]

fsck wrappers have been imported; this feature provides infrastructure
for fsck(8) to work on different types of filesystems (analogous to
mount(8) and mount_*(8)).

ncurses has been updated to ncurses-5.1-20001009. [MERGED]

gperf has been updated to 2.7.2. [MERGED]

style.perl.7, a style guide for Perl code in the FreeBSD base system,
has been added.

The ISC library from the BIND distribution is now built as
libisc. [MERGED]

The "in use" percentage metric displayed by netstat(1) now really
reflects the percentage of network mbufs used. [MERGED]

mergemaster(8) has gained some new features, has been cleaned up
somewhat, and is now more cross-platform friendly.

The compiler chain now uses the FSF-supplied C/C++ runtime
initialization code.  This change brings about better compatibility
with code generated from the various egcs and gcc ports, as well as
the stock public FSF source. [MERGED]

The threads library has gained some signal handling changes, bug
fixes, and performance enhancements (including zero system call thread
switching).  gdb(1) thread support has been updated to match these
changes.  [MERGED]

chflags(1) has moved from /usr/bin to /bin.

Use of the CSMG_* macros no longer require inclusion of <sys/param.h>.

IP Filter is now supported by the rc.conf(5) boot-time configuration
and initialization. [MERGED]

The lastlogin(1) utility, which prints the last login time of each
user, has been imported from NetBSD.

newfs(1) now implements write combining, which can make creation of
new filesystems up to seven times faster. [MERGED]

A number of buffer overflows in config(8) have been fixed. [MERGED]

pwd(1) can now double as realpath(1), a program to resolve pathnames
to their underlying physical paths. [MERGED]

file(1) has been contribify-ed, and imported as version 3.33. [MERGED]

stty(1) now has support for an "erase2" control character, so that
both "delete" and "backspace" can be used to erase characters.

The ibcs2(8), linux(8), osf1(8), and svr4(8) scripts, whose sole
purpose was to load emulation kernel modules, have been removed.  The
kernel module system will automatically load them as needed to fulfill
dependencies.

top(1) will now use the full width of its tty.

groff(1) and its related utilities have been updated to FSF version
1.16.1. [MERGED]

growfs(8), a utility for growing FFS filesystems, has been added.
ffsinfo(8), a utility for dump all the meta-information of an existing
filesystem, has also been added.

indent(1) has gained some new formatting options. [MERGED]

sysinstall now uses some more intuitive defaults thanks to some new
dialog support functions.  [MERGED]

The default root partition in sysinstall is now 100MB on the i386 and
110MB on the alpha.

gcc has been updated to 2.95.3.

Shortly after the receipt of a SIGINFO signal (normally control-T from
the controlling tty), fsck_ffs will now output a line indicating the
current phase number and progress information relevant to the current
phase. [MERGED]

Catching up with most other network utilities in the base system,
lpr(1), lpd(8), syslogd(8), and logger(1) are now all IPv6-capable.
[MERGED]

libdisk can now do install-time configuration of the i386 boot0 boot
loader. [MERGED]

rm(1) -v now displays the entire pathname of a file being
removed. [MERGED]

lpr(1), lpq(1), and lpd(8) have received a few minor
enhancements. [MERGED]

pkg_update(1), a utility to update installed packages and update their
dependencies, has been added.

pkg_info(1) now supports globbing against names of installed packages.
The -G option disables this behavior, and the -x option causes regular
expression matching instead of shell globbing. [MERGED]

If the first argument fo ancontrol(8) or wicontrol(8) doesn't start
with a "-", it is assumed to be an interface.

rdist(1) has been retired.

Kerberos IV has been updated to 1.0.5.

ppp(8) has gained the tcpmssfixup option, which adjusts outgoing TCP
SYN packets so that the maximum receive segment size is no larger than
allowed by the interface MTU.

libcrypt and libdescrypt have been unified to provide a configurable
password authentication hash library.  Both the md5 and des hash methods
are provided unless the des hash is specifically compiled out.

passwd(1) and pw(8) now select the passwd hash algorithm at run time.  See
the "passwd_format" attribute in /etc/login.conf.

In preparation for meeting SUSv2/POSIX <sys/select.h> requirements,
'struct selinfo' and related functions have been moved to
<sys/selinfo.h>.

gcc now uses a unified libgcc rather than a separate one for threaded
and non-threaded programs.  /usr/lib/libgcc_r.a can be removed. [MERGED]

syslogd(8) now supports a "LOG_CONSOLE" facility (disabled by
default), which can be used to log /dev/console output. [MERGED]

rpcgen now uses /usr/bin/cpp (as on NetBSD), not /usr/libexec/cpp.

Boot-time syscons configuration was moved to a machine-independent
rc.syscons. [MERGED]

burncd(8) now supports a -m option for multisession mode (the default
behavior now is to close disks as single-session).  A -l option to
take a list of image files from a filename was also added; '-' can be
used as a filename for stdin. [MERGED]

dmesg(8) now has a -a option to show the entire message buffer,
including syslog records and /dev/console output. [MERGED]

In /etc/ssh/sshd_config, the ConnectionsPerPeriod parameter has been
deprecated in favor of MaxStartups. [MERGED]

cdcontrol(1) now uses the CDROM environment variable to pick a default
device. [MERGED]

sysctl(8) now supports a -N option to print out variable names only.

All packages and ports now contain an "origin" directive, which makes
it easier for programs like pkg_version(1) to determine the directory
from which a package was built. [MERGED]

sysinstall(8) now lives in /usr/sbin, which simplifies the installation
process.  The sysinstall(8) manpage is also installed in a more
consistent fashion now.

config(8) is now better about converting various warnings that should
have been errors into actual fatal errors with an exit code.  This
ensures that that 'make buildkernel' doesn't quietly ignore them and
build a bogus kernel without a human to read the errors. [MERGED]

pkg_create(1) and pkg_add(1) can now work with packages that have
been compressed using bzip2(1).  pkg_add(1) will use the
PACKAGEROOT environment variable to determine a mirror site for new
packages. [MERGED]

pkg_info(1) can now accept a -g flag for verifying an installed
package against its recorded checksums (to see if it's been modified
post-installation).  Naturally, this mechanism is only as secure as
the contents of /var/db/pkg if it's to be used for auditing
purposes. [MERGED]

libc is now thread-safe by default; libc_r contains only thread functions.

find(1) now takes the -empty flag, which returns true if a file or
directory is empty. [MERGED]

find(1) now takes the -iname and -ipath primaries for case-insensitive
matches, and the -regexp and -iregexp primaries for regular-expression
matches.  The -E flag now enables extended regular
expressions. [MERGED]

tftpd(8) now takes the -c and -C options, which allow the server to
chroot(2) based on the IP address of the connecting client.  tftp(1)
and tftpd(8) can now transfer files larger than 65535 blocks.

vidcontrol(1) now accepts a -g parameter to select custom text
geometry in the VESA_800x600 raster text mode. [MERGED]

ldconfig(8) now checks directory ownerships and permissions for
greater security; these checks can be disabled with the -i
flag. [MERGED]

The rfork_thread(3) library call has been added as a helper function
to rfork(2).  Using this function should avoid the need to implement
complex stack swap code. [MERGED]

Significant additions have been made to internationalization support;
FreeBSD now has complete locale support for the LC_MONETARY,
LC_NUMERIC, and LC_MESSAGES categories.  A number of applications have
been updated to take advantage of this support.

A compat4x distribution has been added for compatibility with FreeBSD
4-STABLE.

The compat3x distribution has been updated to include libraries
present in FreeBSD 3.5.1-RELEASE. [MERGED]

savecore(8) now supports a -k option to prevent clearing a crash dump
after saving it.  It also attempts to avoid writing large stretches of
zeros to crash dump files to save space and time.

When requested to delete multiple packages, pkg_delete(1) will now
attempt to remove them in dependency order rather than the order
specified on the command line. [MERGED]

pkg_delete(1) now can perform glob/regexp matching of package names.
In addition, it supports the -a option for removing all packages and
the -i option for rm(1)-style interactive confirmation.

tar(1) now supports the TAR_RSH variable, principally to enable the
use of ssh(1) as a transport. [MERGED]

disklabel(8) now supports partition sizes expressed in kilobytes,
megabytes, or gigabytes, in addition to sectors.

The pseudo-random number generator implemented by rand(3) has been
improved to provide less biased results.

login(1) now exports environment variables set by PAM
modules. [MERGED]

wall(1) now supports a -g flag to write a message to all users of a
given group.

The new CPUTYPE make.conf variable controls the compilation of
processor-specific optimizations in various pieces of code such as
OpenSSL.

The default value for the CVS_RSH variable (used by cvs(1)) is now
ssh, rather than rsh.

bc has been updated from 1.04 to 1.06.

ipfstat(8) now supports the -t option to turn on a top(1)-like
display. [MERGED]


2. Supported Configurations

3. Obtaining FreeBSD
--------------------

You may obtain FreeBSD in a variety of ways:


3.1. FTP/Mail
-------------

You can ftp FreeBSD and any or all of its optional packages from
`ftp.FreeBSD.org' - the official FreeBSD release site.

For other locations that mirror the FreeBSD software see the file
MIRROR.SITES.  Please ftp the distribution from the site closest (in
networking terms) to you.  Additional mirror sites are always welcome!
Contact freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org for more details if you'd like to
become an official mirror site.

If you do not have access to the Internet and electronic mail is your
only recourse, then you may still fetch the files by sending mail to
`ftpmail@ftpmail.vix.com' - putting the keyword "help" in your message
to get more information on how to fetch files using this mechanism.
Please do note, however, that this will end up sending many *tens of
megabytes* through the mail and should only be employed as an absolute
LAST resort!


3.2. CDROM
----------

FreeBSD 4.x-RELEASE and 3.x-RELEASE CDs may be ordered on CDROM from:

        BSDi / Walnut Creek CDROM
        4041 Pike Lane, Suite D
        Concord CA  94520
        USA
        +1-800-786-9907, +1-925-674-0783, +1-925-674-0821 (FAX)

Or via the Internet from orders@cdrom.com or http://www.cdrom.com.
Their current catalog can be obtained via ftp from:

        ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/cdrom/catalog

Cost per -RELEASE CD is $39.95 or $24.95 with a FreeBSD subscription.
FreeBSD SNAPshot CDs, when available, are $39.95 or $14.95 with a
FreeBSD-SNAP subscription (-RELEASE and -SNAP subscriptions are entirely
separate).  With a subscription, you will automatically receive updates as
they are released.  Your credit card will be billed when each disk is
shipped and you may cancel your subscription at any time without further
obligation.

Shipping (per order not per disc) is $5 in the US, Canada or Mexico
and $9.00 overseas.  They accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American
Express or checks in U.S. Dollars and ship COD within the United
States.  California residents please add 8.25% sales tax.

Should you be dissatisfied for any reason, the CD comes with an
unconditional return policy.


4. Upgrading from previous releases of FreeBSD
----------------------------------------------

If you're upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD, most likely
it's 3.0 and there may be some issues affecting you, depending
of course on your chosen method of upgrading.  There are two popular
ways of upgrading FreeBSD distributions:

        o Using sources, via /usr/src
        o Using sysinstall's (binary) upgrade option.

Please read the UPGRADE.TXT file for more information, preferably
before beginning an upgrade.


5. Reporting problems, making suggestions, submitting code.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Your suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are always
valued - please do not hesitate to report any problems you may find
(preferably with a fix attached, if you can!).

The preferred method to submit bug reports from a machine with
Internet mail connectivity is to use the send-pr command or use the CGI
script at http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html.  Bug reports
will be dutifully filed by our faithful bugfiler program and you can
be sure that we'll do our best to respond to all reported bugs as soon
as possible.  Bugs filed in this way are also visible on our WEB site
in the support section and are therefore valuable both as bug reports
and as "signposts" for other users concerning potential problems to
watch out for.

If, for some reason, you are unable to use the send-pr command to
submit a bug report, you can try to send it to:

                freebsd-bugs@FreeBSD.org

Note that send-pr itself is a shell script that should be easy to move
even onto a totally different system.  We much prefer if you could use
this interface, since it make it easier to keep track of the problem
reports.  However, before submitting, please try to make sure whether
the problem might have already been fixed since.


Otherwise, for any questions or tech support issues, please send mail to:

                freebsd-questions@FreeBSD.org


If you're tracking the -current development efforts, you should
definitely join the -current mailing list, in order to keep abreast
of recent developments and changes that may affect the way you
use and maintain the system:

		freebsd-current@FreeBSD.org


Additionally, being a volunteer effort, we are always happy to have
extra hands willing to help - there are already far more desired
enhancements than we'll ever be able to manage by ourselves!  To
contact us on technical matters, or with offers of help, please send
mail to:

                freebsd-hackers@FreeBSD.org


Please note that these mailing lists can experience *significant*
amounts of traffic and if you have slow or expensive mail access and
are only interested in keeping up with significant FreeBSD events, you
may find it preferable to subscribe instead to:

                freebsd-announce@FreeBSD.org


All of the mailing lists can be freely joined by anyone wishing
to do so.  Send mail to MajorDomo@FreeBSD.org and include the keyword
`help' on a line by itself somewhere in the body of the message.  This
will give you more information on joining the various lists, accessing
archives, etc.  There are a number of mailing lists targeted at
special interest groups not mentioned here, so send mail to majordomo
and ask about them!


6. Acknowledgments

Special mention to:

        The donors listed at http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/donors.html

        Justin M. Seger <jseger@FreeBSD.org> for almost single-handedly
        converting the ports collection to ELF.

        Doug Rabson <dfr@FreeBSD.org> and John Birrell <jb@FreeBSD.org>
        for making FreeBSD/alpha happen and to the NetBSD project for
        substantial indirect aid.

        Peter Wemm <peter@FreeBSD.org> for the new kernel module system
        (with substantial aid from Doug Rabson).

        And to the many thousands of FreeBSD users and testers all over the
        world, without whom this release simply would not have been possible.
