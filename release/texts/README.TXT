TARGET AUDIENCE:
----------------
This release is aimed primarily at early-adopters and the various
other folks who want to get involved with the ongoing development
of FreeBSD and are willing to deal with a few bumps in the road.
We do our best to ensure that each snapshot works as advertised,
but tracking -current is a process which frequently has its off
days.

If you're both technically proficient and know exactly what you're
getting into here (e.g. you've been following -current) then this
snapshot is probably for you.  If you're more interested in doing
business with FreeBSD than in playing with the cutting edge of
technology, however, then 3.x or 4.x is almost certainly your best
bet.


Most information here is also available from the Documentation menu
during installation.

  ERRATA.TXT    Read this file!  It will tell you where to look for the
                latest information on problems which have been found and
                fixed since this release was created (and may bite you).

  README.TXT    This file

  ABOUT.TXT     All about FreeBSD, including contact information

  RELNOTES.TXT  Release Notes - what's new & different in this release

  LAYOUT.TXT    Information about the layout of the release directory.
                If you are installing from floppies, it is especially
                important that you read this section!

  HARDWARE.TXT  Information about the configuration of the GENERIC kernel
                and supported hardware.  New installers should read this
                file.

  INSTALL.TXT   Installation instructions - new installers should read this.

  UPGRADE.TXT   Upgrading an existing FreeBSD installation

  TROUBLE.TXT   General troubleshooting information


o It is, again, very important to check the ERRATA.TXT file for any
  late-breaking issues with this release.  If you don't read the ERRATA,
  you will probably fall right into the same problems that have already
  been reported (and fixed as noted in the ERRATA).


If you're a developer/hobbiest and not interested in QA'd releases
so much as simply keeping up to date on the latest FreeBSD technology,
you can also install one of our "snapshot" releases.

For the most up-to-date software along the RELENG_3 branch
(also known as 3.5-stable), please install your snapshots from:

        ftp://releng3.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/

For the most up-to-date software along the RELENG_4 branch
(also known as 4.0-stable), now proceeding towards the release

For the latest 5.0-current (HEAD branch) snapshot releases,
please install from:

If you plan to run either -Stable or -Current you MUST be

We hope you enjoy using FreeBSD as much as we enjoyed
creating it!
