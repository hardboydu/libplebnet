TARGET AUDIENCE:
----------------
This release is aimed primarily at early-adopters and the various
other folks who want to get involved with the ongoing development
of FreeBSD and are willing to deal with a few bumps in the road.
We do our best to ensure that each snapshot works as advertised,
but tracking -current is a process which frequently has its off
days.

If you're both technically proficient and know exactly what you're
getting into here (e.g. you've been following -current) then this
snapshot is probably for you.  If you're more interested in doing
business with FreeBSD than in playing with the cutting edge of
technology, however, then 3.x is almost certainly your best bet.
