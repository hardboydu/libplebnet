delete it later if it turns out you don't need it.  This is
a little rough, yes, but I'm working on it!

You're now done with the installation of XFree86 3.1.
Now would probably be a very good time to look in ${BASEDIR}/lib/X11/doc
for further information on what to do next.  XFree86 3.1 is now
installed in the ${BASEDIR} directory, unlike
earlier releases.  For backwards compatibility, you might consider
a symlink to /usr/X386." -1 -1
