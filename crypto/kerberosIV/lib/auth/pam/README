PAM
---

The PAM module was written more out of curiosity that anything else. It
has not been updated for quite a while, since none of us are using
Linux, and Solaris does not support PAM yet.  We've had positive reports
from at least one person using the module, though.

To use this module you should:

   * Make sure `pam_krb4.so' is available in `/usr/athena/lib'. You
     might actually want it on local disk, so `/lib/security' might be a
     better place if `/usr/athena' is not local.

   * Look at `pam.conf.add' for examples of what to add to
     `/etc/pam.conf'.

There is currently no support for changing kerberos passwords. Use
kpasswd instead.

See also Derrick J Brashear's `<shadow@dementia.org>' Kerberos PAM
module at `ftp://ftp.dementia.org/pub/pam'. It has a lot more features,
and it is also more in line with other PAM modules.
