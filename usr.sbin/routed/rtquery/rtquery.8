.Sh NAME
.Nm rtquery
.Nd query routing daemons for their routing tables
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl np1
.Op Fl 1 Ar timeout
.Op Fl r Ar addr
.Ar host ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Rtquery
is used to query a network routing daemon,
.Xr routed 8
or
.Xr gated 8 ,
for its routing table by sending a
.Em request
or
.Em poll
command.  The routing information in any routing
.Em response
packets returned is displayed numerically and symbolically.
.Pp
.Em Rtquery
by default uses the
.Em request
command.
When the
.B \-p
option is specified,
.Nm rtquery
uses the
.Em poll
command, which is an
undocumented extension to the RIP specification supported by
.IR gated (1M).
When querying
.IR gated (1M),
the
.I poll
command is preferred over the
.I request
command because the response is not subject to Split Horizon and/or
Poisioned Reverse.
.Pp
Options supported by
.Nm rtquery :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n
Normally network and host numbers are displayed both symbolically
and numerically.
The
.Fl n
option displays only the numeric network and host numbers.
.It Fl p
Uses the
.Em poll
command to request full routing information from
.Xr gated 8 ,
This is an undocumented extension supported only by
.Xr gated 8 .
.It Fl 1
query using RIP version 1 instead of RIP version 2.
.It Fl w Ar timeout
changes the delay for an answer from each host.
By default, each host is given 15 seconds to respond.
.It Fl r Ar addr
ask about the route to destination
.Em parms
