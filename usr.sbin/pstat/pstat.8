.Sh NAME
.Nm pstat ,
.Nm swapinfo
.Nd display system data structures
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Tfiknstv
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Pp
.Nm swapinfo
.Op Fl k
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Pstat
displays open file entry, swap space utilization,
terminal state, and vnode data structures.
If
.Ar corefile
is given, the information is sought there, otherwise
in
.Pa /dev/mem .
The required namelist is taken from
.Pa /kernel
unless 
.Ar system
is specified.
.Pp
If invoked as 
.Nm swapinfo
the 
.Fl s
option is implied, and only the
.Fl k
option is legal.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n
Print devices out by major/minor instead of name.
.It Fl k
Print sizes in kilobytes, regardless of the setting of the
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
environment variable.
.It Fl T
Print the number of used and free slots in the several system tables
and is useful for checking to see how large system tables have become
if the system is under heavy load.
.It Fl f
Print the open file table with these headings:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It LOC
The core location of this table entry.
.It TYPE
The type of object the file table entry points to.
.It FLG
Miscellaneous state variables encoded thus:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It R
open for reading
.It W
open for writing
.It A
open for appending
.It S
shared lock present
.It X
exclusive lock present
.It I
signal pgrp when data ready
.El
.It CNT
Number of processes that know this open file.
.It MSG
Number of messages outstanding for this file.
.It DATA
The location of the vnode table entry or socket structure for this file.
.It OFFSET
The file offset (see
.Xr lseek 2 ) .
.El
.It Fl s
Print information about swap space usage on all the 
swap areas compiled into the kernel.
The first column is the device name of the partition.  The next column is
the total space available in the partition.  The 
.Ar Used
column indicates the total blocks used so far;  the 
.Ar Available
column indicates how much space is remaining on each partition.
The
.Ar Capacity
reports the percentage of space used.
.Pp
If more than one partition is configured into the system, totals for all
of the statistics will be reported in the final line of the report.
.Pp
If you supply the option again, as in
.Fl ss ,
the system will display a breakdown of the swap bitmap/radix-tree.
.It Fl t
Print table for terminals
with these headings:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It RAW
Number of characters in raw input queue.
.It CAN
Number of characters in canonicalized input queue.
.It OUT
Number of characters in output queue.
.It MODE
See
.Xr tty 4 .
.It ADDR
Physical device address.
.It DEL
Number of delimiters (newlines) in canonicalized input queue.
.It COL
Calculated column position of terminal.
.It STATE
Miscellaneous state variables encoded thus:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It T
delay timeout in progress
.It W
waiting for open to complete
.It O
open
.It F
outq has been flushed during DMA
.It C
carrier is on
.It c
connection open
.It B
busy doing output
.It A
process is waiting for space in output queue
.It a
process is waiting for output to complete
.It X
open for exclusive use
.It S
output stopped (ixon flow control)
.It m
output stopped (carrier flow control)
.It o
output stopped (CTS flow control)
.It d
output stopped (DSR flow control)
.It K
input stopped
.It Y
send SIGIO for input events
.It D
state for lowercase
.Ql \e
work
.It E
within a
.Ql \e.../
for PRTRUB
.It L
next character is literal
.It P
retyping suspended input (PENDIN)
.It N
counting tab width, ignore FLUSHO
.It l
block mode input routine in use
.It s
i/o being snooped
.It Z
connection lost
.El
.It SESS
Kernel address of the session structure.
.It PGID
Process group for which this is controlling terminal.
.It DISC
Line discipline;
.Ql term
for
TTYDISC
or
.Ql ntty
for
NTTYDISC
or
.Ql tab
for
TABLDISC
or
.Ql slip
for
SLIPDISC
or
.Ql ppp
for
PPPDISC.
.El
.It Fl v
Print the active vnodes.  Each group of vnodes corresponding
to a particular filesystem is preceded by a two line header.  The
first line consists of the following:
.Pp
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.No *** MOUNT Em fstype from 
on
.Em on fsflags
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Em fstype
is one of
.Em ufs , nfs , mfs , or pc ;
.Em from
is the filesystem is mounted from;
.Em on
is the directory
the filesystem is mounted on; and
.Em fsflags
is a list
of optional flags applied to the mount (see
.Xr mount 8 ) .
The second line is a header for the individual fields,
the first part of which are fixed, and the second part are filesystem
type specific.  The headers common to all vnodes are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It ADDR
Location of this vnode.
.It TYP
File type.
.It VFLAG
.Pp
A list of letters representing vnode flags:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It R

.It t
\- VISTTY
.It L
\- VXLOCK

.El
.Pp
.It USE
The number of references to this vnode.
.It HOLD
The number of I/O buffers held by this vnode.
.It FILEID
The vnode fileid.
In the case of
.Em ufs
this is the inode number.

.El
.It "For nfs:"
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It W
waiting for I/O buffer flush to complete
.It P
I/O buffers being flushed
.It M

.It X

.El
.El
.It SIZ/RDEV
