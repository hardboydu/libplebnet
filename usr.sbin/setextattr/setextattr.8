.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm setextattr
.Ar attrname
.Ar filename

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a user tool to set a named extended attribute on a file or directory to
the provided string.
The

argument should be the name of the attribute,
.Ar filename
the name of the file or directory to set the attribute for, and
.Ar attrvalue
a string to store in the attribute.
.Nm
will store the string in the file's attribute.
In order for

to succeed, the attribute service must be available on the file system,
and appropriate privilege may be required.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
.Dl # setextattr md5 /kernel `md5 -q /kernel`
.Pp
Set the ``md5'' extended attribute on the file /kernel to the string
containing the output of ``md5 -q /kernel''.
