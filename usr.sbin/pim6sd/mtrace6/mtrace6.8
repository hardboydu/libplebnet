.Sh NAME
.Nm mtrace6
.Nd print IPv6 multicast path from a source to
a receiver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar destination
.Op Fl g Ar gateway
.Op Fl h Ar hops
.Op Fl i Ar interface
.Op Fl m Ar maxhops
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl r Ar response_addr
.Op Fl w Ar waittime
.Ar source
.Ar group
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
utilizes a tracing feature implemented in multicast routers that is
accessed via an extension to the MLD protocol.
A trace query is
passed hop-by-hop along the reverse path from the
.Ar destination
to the
.Ar source ,
collecting hop addresses, packet counts, and routing error conditions
along the path, and then the response is returned to the requestor.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar destination
Specifies the multicast receiver that the query wants to trace.
It is the host running
.Nm
by default.
.It Fl g Ar gateway
Send the trace query via unicast directly to the multicast router
.Ar gateway .
The unicast router must be the last-hop router on the path from the
intended source to the receiver.
.Ar gateway
can also be a multicast address that the last hop router joins.
.It Fl h Ar hops
Set
.Ar hops
to the IPv6 hop limit field of query packets.
The default is 64.
.It Fl i Ar interface
Specifies the local interface (on a multi-homed host) for sending
the trace query and as the default for the receiver and the response
destination.
.It Fl m Ar maxhops
Set to
.Ar maxhops
to the maximum number of hops that will be traced from the receiver
back toward the source.
The default is 127 hops.
.It Fl n
Print hop addresses numerically rather than symbolically and numerically
(saves a nameserver address-to-name lookup for each router found on
the path).
.It Fl r Ar response_addr
Specify the host that the trace response sends to.
By default, the response will send to the host running
.Nm Ns .
.It Fl w Ar waittime
Set the time to wait for a trace response to
.Ar waittime
seconds.
The default is 3 seconds.

.Xr pim6dd 8 ,
.Xr pim6sd 8
.Sh BUGS
Multicast trace for IPv6 is experimental.
MLD types for query and
response, and packet format are not officially defined.
.Pp
.Ar waittime
specified by the
.Fl w
option is currently meaningless.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
.Pp
IPv6 and IPsec support based on the KAME Project (http://www.kame.net/) stack
was initially integrated into
.Fx 4.0
