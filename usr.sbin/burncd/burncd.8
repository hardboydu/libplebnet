.Ar command 
may be one of:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX
.It Ar blank
Blank a CD-RW medium. This uses the fast blanking method, so data are not physically overwritten, only those areas that make the media appear blank for further usage.
.It Ar fixate
Fixate the medium so that the TOC is generated and the media can be used in an ordinary CD drive. The driver defaults to creating multisession media. Should be the last command to 
.Nm
as the program exits when this has been done.
.It Ar raw | audio
Set the write mode to produce audio (raw mode) tracks for the following images on the command line.
.It Ar data | mode1
Set the write mode to produce data (mode1) tracks for the following image files
on the command line.
.It Ar filename
All other arguments are treated as filenames of images to write to the media.
.El
.Pp
Files whose length are not a multiple of the current media blocksize are quietly zero padded to fit the blocksize requirement.
.Pp

.Bd -literal
# burncd -f /dev/acd0c audio file1 file2 file3 fixate
.Pp
The typical usage for burning a mixed mode CD-R:
.Bd -literal
# burncd -f /dev/acd0c data file1 audio file2 file3 fixate
