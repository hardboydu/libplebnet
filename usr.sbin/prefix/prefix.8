.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to assign an prefix
to a network interface and/or renumbering
network interface prefixes.
.Nm
must be used at boot time to define the network prefix
of each interface present on a machine; it may also be used at
a later time to renumbering multiple interface's prefixes
and other prefix related parameters.
.Nm
is router-only command, so you must do following to use it.
.Dl % sysctl -w net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1
If net.inet6.ip6.forwarding is set to 0,
.Nm
command fails by
.Er EPERM
error.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar interface
Specify an
.Ar interface
for which
.Ar prefix
is/are assigned or renumbered to.
This parameter is a string of the form
.Dq name unit ,
for example,
.Dq en0 .
.It Ar prefix
Assign/Delete an
.Ar prefix
to a network interface.
.It Cm prefixlen Ar len
Specify that
.Ar len
bits are reserved as identifier for IPv6 sub-networks in
.Ar prefix .
The
.Ar len
must be integer, and for syntactical reason it must be between 0 to 128.
It is almost always 64 under the current IPv6 assignment rule.
If the parameter is ommitted, 64 is used.
.It Cm matchpr Ar match_prefix
Specify
.Ar match_prefix
that is used for matching with preassigned prefixes to which
.Cm add | change | setglobal
command should be applied.
.It Cm mp_len Ar match_prefix_len
Specify the starting part of
.Ar match_prefix
to be used for matching with preassigned prefixes, as decimal bit number.
.It Cm mp_minlen Ar match_prefix_minlen
Specify the minimum length of prefixes which is allowed to be matched to
.Ar match_prefix ,
as decimal bit number.
.Cm add | change | setglobal
is not applied to preassigned prefixes with smaller prefix len than
.Ar match_prefix_minlen .
.It Cm mp_maxlen Ar match_prefix_maxlen
Specify the maximum length of prefixes which is allowed to be matched to
.Ar match_prefix ,
as decimal bit number.
.Cm add | change | setglobal
is not applied to preassigned prefixes with bigger prefix len than
.Ar match_prefix_maxlen .
.It Cm usepr Ar use_prefix
Specify
.Ar use_prefix
that is used for prefixes to be added on
.Cm add | change | setglobal
command.
.It Cm up_uselen Ar use_prefix_uselen
Specify the starting part of
.Ar use_prefix
copied to the starting part of prefixes to be added on
.Cm add | change | setglobal
command, as decimal bit number.
.It Cm up_keeplen Ar use_prefix_keeplen
Specify the midium part of
.Ar use_prefix
just next to the starting part specified by
.Ar use_prefix_uselen
, as decimal bit number.
Contiguous bits part in the same bit position of an existent prefix
matched with
.Ar match_prefix
is copied to the same bit position of prefixes to be added.
.It Cm pltime Ar time
Assign an
.Ar time
as prefix preferred life time for a prefix to be added.
Valid value for
.Ar time
is decimal seconds number or special format as "d00h00m00s00",
where 00 can take any decimal number, and "d" means days, "h" means hours,
"m" means minutes, "s" means seconds. And alternatively, special keyword
"infinity" can be also be specified.
.It Cm vltime Ar time
Assign an
.Ar time
as prefix valid life time for a prefix to be added.
Valid value for
.Ar time
is same as for
.Cm pltime .
.It Cm raf_auto
Enable the autonomous address auto configuration for the prefix to be
added.
.It Fl raf_auto
Disable the autonomous address auto configuration for the prefix to be
added.
.It Cm raf_onlink
Let the prefix to be added to have onlink nature for the assigned
interface.
.It Fl raf_onlink
Let the prefix to be added not to have onlink nature for the assigned
interface.
.It Cm rrf_decrprefd
Enable the decrementation of the pltime.
.It Fl rrf_decrprefd
Disable the decrementation of the pltime.
.It Cm rrf_decrvalid
Enable the decrementation of the vltime.
.It Fl rrf_decrvalid
Disable the decrementation of the vltime.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Messages indicating the specified interface does not exist, the
requested prefix is unknown, or the user is not privileged and
tried to alter an interface's configuration.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
.Pp
IPv6 and IPsec support based on the KAME Project (http://www.kame.net/) stack
was initially integrated into
.Fx 4.0
