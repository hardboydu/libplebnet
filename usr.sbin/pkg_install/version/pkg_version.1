.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_version
.Nd summarize installed versions of packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkg_version
.Op Fl cdhv
.Op Ar index
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to produce a report of non-base software packages
installed using the 
.Xr pkg_add 1
command.  Version numbers are compared against an
index file, to see which packages might need updating.
.Pp
Each package name is printed, along with a one-character status flag:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Li =
The installed version of the package matches the index.
.It Li <
The installed version of the package is older than the version listed
in the index.
.It Li >
The installed version of the package is newer than listed in the
index.
.It Li ?
The relationship between the installed version of a package and the
index file could not be determined.  A common reason for this message
is that there are multiple versions of a particular software package
installed, or that multiple versions are listed in the index file.
Examples from the
.Fx 2.2.6
ports collection are the Tcl toolkit or the
.Tn EMACS
editor.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Nm 
supports several command-line arguments:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Enable commands output.  Commands output includes the commands you should
type to update your installed packages to the latest versions in the ports
system.
.It Fl d
Enable debugging output.
.It Fl h
Print help message.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose output.  Verbose output includes some English-text
interpretations of the version number comparisons, as well as the
version numbers compared for each package.  Non-verbose output is
probably easier for programs or scripts to parse.
.It Ar index
Specify the index to be used as a basis of comparison.  This index can
be specified as a filename (in the local filesystem) or a URL.  Any
URL understandable by
.Xr fetch 1
can be used here.  If no
.Ar index
file is specified on the command line,
.Pa /usr/ports/INDEX
is used.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fetch 1 ,
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
.Xr pkg_create 1 ,
.Xr pkg_delete 1 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/ports/INDEX -compact
.It Pa /usr/ports/INDEX
Default index file.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following is a typical invocation of the
.Nm
command, which checks the installed packages against the local ports
index file:
.Pp
.Dl % pkg_version -v
.Pp
The command below generates a report against
the version numbers in the on-line ports collection:
.Pp
.Dl % pkg_version ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports-current/INDEX
.Pp
The command below generates a file of commands to run to update the installed
files. It is
.Bf Em
not
.Ef
suggested that you run these commands automatically. Always review the
suggestions, and then cut-and-paste (or retype) the commands you want to run.
.Pp
.Dl % pkg_version -c > do_update

.Sh BUGS
There should be a better way of dealing with packages that
can have more than one installed version.
.Pp
Patch levels aren't handled
very well (i.e. version numbers of the form 1.2p3 or 1.2pl3).
.Pp
Updates to packages
that don't change the version number (e.g. small delta bugfixes in the
package/port itself) aren't detected.
.Pp
Commands output doesn't know about dependencies between packages. For
example, you might have two versions of Tcl installed because two other
packages require the different versions.
.Nm
will suggest removing the out-of-date version.
.Pp
Commands output assumes you install new software using the ports system,
rather than using
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
