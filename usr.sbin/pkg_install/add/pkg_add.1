would be taken if it was.
.B "Optional."

.SH "TECHNICAL DETAILS"
.B
pkg_add
is fairly simple.  It simply extracts the requested packages into
the current working directory and then performs the following steps:
.PP
If the package contains a
.B require
file (see 
.B pkg_create
), then this is executed first with the flag
.b INSTALL
to see whether or not installation should
continue (a non-zero exit status means no).  
.PP
If an
.B install
script exists for the package, it is then executed as follows:
.PP
First, before installing files in the data set, the
.B install
script is called with the flags
.PP
.B <script>
.I pkg-name PRE-INSTALL
.PP
Where
.I pkg-name
is the name of the package in question and
.I PRE-INSTALL
is a keyword denoting that this is the "pre installation" pass.
Files are then copied from the packing list into their new homes, as expected,
and the
.B install
script is then executed a second time with the flags
.PP
.B <script>
.I pkg-name POST-INSTALL
.PP
This all allows you to write an
.B install
script that does "before and after" actions.
.PP
After installation is complete, a copy of the packing list, in addition
to any
.B deinstall
script the package might have, is copied into /var/pkg/<pkg-name>
for subsequent possible use by
.B pkg-delete.
.PP
.SH BUGS
Sure to be some.
