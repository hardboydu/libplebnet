.Sh NAME
.Nm jexec
.Nd "execute a command inside an existing jail"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl u Ar username | Fl U Ar username
.Op Fl n Ar jailname
.Ar jid command ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility executes
.Ar command
inside the jail identified by either
.Ar jailname
or
.Ar jid
or both.
.Pp
If the jail cannot be identified uniquely by the given parameters,
an error message is printed.
.Nm
will also check the state of the jail (once supported) to be
.Dv ALIVE
and ignore jails in other states.
The mandatory argument
.Ar jid
is the unique jail identifier as given by
.Xr jls 8 .
In case you only want to match on other criteria, give an empty string.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n Ar jailname
The name of the jail, if given upon creation of the jail.
This is not the hostname of the jail.
.It Fl u Ar username
The user name from host environment as whom the
.Ar command
should run.
.It Fl U Ar username
The user name from jailed environment as whom the
.Ar command
should run.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr jail_attach 2 ,
.Xr jail 8 ,
.Xr jls 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility was added in
.Fx 5.1 .
.Sh BUGS
If the jail is not identified by
.Ar jid
there is a possible race in between the lookup of the jail
and executing the command inside the jail.
Giving a
.Ar jid
has a similar race as another process can stop the jail and
start another one after the user looked up the
.Ar jid .
