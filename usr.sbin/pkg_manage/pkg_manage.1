.B pkg_manage
\- Package manager 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
.B pkg_manage
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pkg_manage is an interactive tool with which you can install, 
delete and view packages. It is essentially a 
front-end to the pkg_add(1), pkg_info(1) and pkg_delete(1) programs
which uses the new libdialog extensions for the GUI.

Pressing F1 (or '?') at any time during the program will bring up 
on-line help.  (Pressing '?' will not invoke help when in character 
input fields).

.SH NAVIGATING THE MENU
At start time, pkg_manage will present a menu with the following choices:

.TP
.B 1. View installed.
You will be offered an overview of the installed 
packages. Moving the cursor to a package name and pressing the
.B Enter
key will show additional information for the package. Use the 
.B PgUp
and 
.B PgDn
keys to page through the information.  Press the
.B Enter
key (this selects the 
.B <EXIT>
button) to return to the `View installed Packages' menu. 

When done viewing packages, move the cursor to the 
.B <Cancel> 
button with the right-arrow key (or left-arrow key) 
and press Enter. This will return you to the main menu.

.TP
.B 2. Delete installed
You can select a package from the list of installed packages for deletion.
Move the cursor to the package you wish to delete and press Enter. This will
bring up another menu from which you can choose to either:

.B 1. Simulate delete:
Have a look at the commands that are going to be executed rather than
executing them (recommended).
.B 2. Delete:
Execute the commands to delete the package.
.B 3. Cancel:
Do 
.B NOT
execute the commands to delete the package and return to the 
previous menu.

Choose the 
.B <Cancel>
button if you don't want to delete any packages 
and return to the main menu.

.TP
.B 3. View pkg files
Take a look at the descriptions of not-yet-installed packages and see if you 
want any of them or not. 
For this option, you'll be asked to chose a package file name using the new
file selector object. See below for a description of the usage of the
file selector.

.TP
.B 4. Install pkg files
Install packages of your choice. Use the file selector to select a 
package.

.TP
.B 5. Quit
Well, just try this one if you get fed up fiddling with your packages.

.SH USING THE FILE SELECTOR

Using the file selector is really quite simple, with a typical file selector
dialog looking something like this:

.nf

.fi
You may use the 
.B TAB 
key to move forward from one input or display field to 
the next. If enabled in the termcap file, 
.B Shift-TAB 
will also move backwards.
Pressing the
.B Enter
key in a field will commit any changes you may have made and 
move to the next field. Pressing the
.B TAB 
key will discard any changes and move to the next field.

The 
.B "Filemask:" 
field controls what kind of files will be displayed in the 
.B "Files:" 
list. The expression follows the same globbing rules that your shell
does, e.g.  \'*.tgz' will only show files having names ending with '.tgz'.

The
.B "Directory:"
field displays the current directory. You can also type another directory 
name into this field. 

The 
.B "Directories:" 
list enables you to browse the filesystem. Select 
.B '..'
and press Enter to
go up the directory tree, select any other directory listed to descend
into that directory.

Finally, there three more fields: The 
.B Selection:
, the 
.B <Ok>
button and the 
.B <Cancel> 
button. The file chosen in the 
.B Files:
field, assuming you pressed Enter, will be displayed in the 
.B Selection:
field. You can also change this value directly by editing the field. 

When you are satisfied with the current selection you can move the cursor
to the
.B <Ok>
button and press Enter. If you want to back out, move the cursor to the 
.B <Cancel> 
button and press Enter.
