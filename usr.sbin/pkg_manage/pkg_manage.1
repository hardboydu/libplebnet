.SH DESCRIPTION
Pkg_manage is an interactive tool with wich you can install,

front-end to the pkg_add(1), pkg_info(1) and pkg_delete(1) programs.

Pressing F1 (or '?') at anytime during the program will bring up 
online-help.  (Pressing '?' will not work in character input fields)

.SH NAVIGATING THE MENU
When starting pkg_manage you will be put in a menu with the following 
choices:

.TP
.B 1. View installed.
You will be offered an overview of the installed 
packages. Moving the cursor to a packagename and pressing 'enter'
will show additional information for the package. Use the 
.B PgUp
and 
.B PgDn
keys to page through the information. Press
.B Enter
(this selects the 
.B <EXIT>
button) to return to the 'View installed Packages' menu. 

When done viewing packages move the cursor to the 
.B <Cancel> 
button with the right-arrow key (or left-arrow key) 
and press enter. This will return you to the main-menu.

.TP
.B 2. Delete installed
You can choose a package from the installed ones to delete. Move the 
cursor to the package you wish to delete and press enter. This will
bring up another menu from which you can choose to either:

.B 1. Simulate delete:
Have a look at the commands that are going to be executed (recommended).
.B 2. Delete:
Execute the commands to delete the package.
.B 3. Cancel:
Do 
.B NOT
execute the commands to delete the package and return to the 
previous menu.

Choose the

button if you don't want to delete any packages 
and return to the main-menu.

Use the 
.B TAB 
key to move forwards from one input/display field to 
the next. If enabled in the termcap, 
.B Shift-TAB 
will move backwards.
Pressing enter in a field will perform the changes you may have made and 
move to the next field. Pressing 
.B TAB 
will discard the changes and move to the next field.

The 
.B "Filemask:" 
controls what kind of files will be displayed in the 
.B "Files:" 
list. The expression follows the same rules as your shell does, i.e.
\'*.tgz' will only show files having names ending with '.tgz'.

.B "Directory:"
displays the current directory. You can also type in another directory 
in this field. 

The 
.B "Directories:" 
list enables you to browse the filesystem. Select 
.B '..'
and press enter to
go up the directory tree, select any other directory listed to descent 
into that directory.

Finally there three more fields: The 
.B Selection:
, the 
.B <Ok>
button and the 
.B <Cancel> 
button. The file chosen in the 
.B Files:
field, assuming you pressed enter, will be displayed in the 
.B Selection:
field. You can also change this value directly by editing the field. 

When you are satisfied with the current selection you can move the cursor
to the
.B <Ok>
button and press enter. If you want to back out, move the cursor to the 
.B <Cancel> 
button and press enter.
