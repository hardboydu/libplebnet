- fixed a bug with respect to the parsing of the pkg_info output
- implemented get_desc() which extracts +DESC and +COMMENT from the 
  packages. This is still done the stupid way (slow).
- install_batch(): two lists, one containing the to be installed 
  packages from the chosen directory, the other containing the 
  allready installed packages.
