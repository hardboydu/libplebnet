.Sh NAME
.Nm sysinstall
.Nd system installation and configuration tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar var=value
.Op Ar sub-function
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility for installing and configuring FreeBSD systems;
it is the first utility invoked by the FreeBSD installation boot
floppy and is also copied into
.Pa /stand
on newly installed FreeBSD systems so that it may be run
later to further configure the system.
.Pp
The
.Nm
program is generally invoked without arguments for the default
behavior which brings up the main installation/configuration menu.

On those occasions where it is deemed necessary to invoke a subsystem
of sysinstall directly, however, it is also possible to do so by
naming the appropriate function entry points on the command line.
Since this action is essentially identical to running an installation
script, with each argument corresponding to a line of script, the
reader is encouraged to read the section on scripting for more
information on this feature.
.Pp
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
is essentially nothing more than a monolithic C program with
the ability to write MBRs and disk labels (through the services
of the
.Xr libdisk 3
library) and install distributions or packages onto new and
existing FreeBSD systems.  It also contains some extra intelligence
for running as a replacement for
.Xr init 8
when it's invoked by the FreeBSD installation boot procedure.  It
assumes very little in the way of additional utility support and
performs most file operations by calling the relevant syscalls
(such as
.Xr mount 2 )
directly.
.Pp
.Nm
currently uses the
.Xr libdialog 3
library to do user interaction with simple ANSI line graphics, color
support for which is enabled by either running on a syscons VTY or some
other color-capable terminal emulator (newer versions of xterm will support
color when using the ``xterm-color'' termcap entry).
.Pp
This product is currently at the end of its life cycle and will
be replaced in FreeBSD 3.0 by the
.Xr setup 1
utility.
.Sh RUNNING SCRIPTS
.Nm
may be either driven interactively through its various internal menus
or run in batch mode, driven by an external script.  Such scripts can
be loaded and executed in one of 3 ways:

.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Sy "LOAD_CONFIG_FILE"
If
.Nm
is compiled with LOAD_CONFIG_FILE set in the environment
(or in the Makefile) to some value, then that value will
be used as the filename to automatically look for and load
when
.Nm
starts up, no interaction on the part of the user being required.
This option is aimed primarily at large sites who wish to create a
single prototype install for multiple machines with largely identical
configurations and/or installation options.

.It Sy "MAIN MENU"
If
.Nm
is run interactively, that is to say in the default manner, it will
bring up a main menu which contains a "load config file" option.
Selecting this option will allow the name of a script file to be
specified and loaded from a DOS or UFS formatted floppy.

.It Sy "COMMAND LINE"
In the same fashion that script directives may be specified one
operation per line in a file, so may each command line argument
be a directive
when
.Nm
is run in multi-user mode.  Execution ends either by explicit request
(e.g. calling the
.Ar shutdown
directive), upon reaching the end of the argument list or on error.
.Pp
For example:
.nf

/stand/sysinstall ftp=ftp:/ziggy/pub/ mediaSetFTP configPackages

.fi
Would initialize
.Nm
for FTP installation media (using the server `ziggy') and then
bring up the package installation editor.  When the package editor
exits, so will
.Nm
.El
.Pp
.Sh SCRIPT SYNTAX
A script is given one or more directives, each directive taking
the form of:

.Ar var=value
.Ar function
or
.Ar #somecomment

Where
.Ar var=value
is the assignment of some internal
.Nm
variable, e.g. "ftpPass=FuNkYChiKn", and
.Ar function
is the name of an internal
.Nm
function, e.g. "mediaSetFTP", and
.Ar #comment
is a single-line comment for documentation purposes (ignored by
sysinstall).  Functions take their arguments by examining known
variable names, requiring that you be sure to assign those values
first before calling the function.  Where a function in the table
below takes such arguments, they will be documented there.

.It diskPartitionEditor
Invokes the disk partition (MBR) editor.
.Pp
\fBVariables:\fR
.Bl -tag -width findx
.It geometry
The disk geometry, as a cyls/heads/sectors formatted string.  Default: no
change to geometry.
.It partition
Set to disk partitioning type or size, its value being
.Ar free
in order to use only remaining free space for FreeBSD,
.Ar all
to use the entire disk for FreeBSD but maintain a proper partition
table,
.Ar existing
to use an existing FreeBSD partition (first found),
.Ar exclusive
to use the disk in ``dangerously dedicated'' mode or, finally,
.Ar somenumber
to allocate
.Ar somenumber
blocks of available free space to a new FreeBSD partition.
Default:  Interactive mode.
.It bootManager
is set to one of
.Ar boot
to signify the installation of a boot manager,
.Ar standard
to signify installation of a "standard" non-boot MGR DOS
MBR or
.Ar none
to indicate that no change to the boot manager is desired.
Default: none.
.El
.Pp
Note: Nothing is actually written to disk by this function, a explicit call to
.Ar diskPartitionWrite
being required for that to happen.
.It diskPartitionWrite
Causes any pending MBR changes (typically from the
.Ar diskPartitionEditor )
to be written out.
.Pp
\fBVariables:\fR None
.It diskLabelEditor
Invokes the disk label editor.  This is a bit trickier from a script
since you need to essentially label everything inside each FreeBSD
(type 0xA5) partition created by the
.Ar diskPartitionEditor
function, and that requires knowing a few rules about how things are
laid out.  When creating a script to automatically allocate disk space
and partition it up, it is suggested that you first perform the
installation interactively at least once and take careful notes as to
what the slice names will be, then and only then hardwiring them into
the script.
.Pp
For example, let's say you have a SCSI disk on which you've created a new
FreeBSD partition in slice 2 (your DOS partition residing in slice 1).
The slice name would be
.Ar sd0s2
for the whole FreeBSD partition (
.Ar sd0s1
being your DOS primary
partition).  Now let's further assume that you have 500MB in this
partition and you want to sub-partition that space into root, swap,
var and usr file systems for FreeBSD.  Your invocation of the
.Ar diskLabelEditor
function might involve setting the following variables:
.Bl -tag -width findx
.It Li "sd0s2-1=ufs 40960 /"
A 20MB root file system (all sizes are in 512 byte blocks).
.It Li "sd0s2-2=swap 131072 /"
A 64MB swap partition.
.It Li "sd0s2-3=ufs 204800 /var"
A 100MB /var file system.
.It Li "sd0s2-4=ufs 0 /usr"
With the balance of free space (around 316MB) going to the /usr
file system.
.El

One can also use the
.Ar diskLabelEditor
for mounting or erasing existing partitions as well as creating new
ones.  Using the previous example again, let's say that we also wanted
to mount our DOS partition and make sure that an
.Pa /etc/fstab
entry is created for it in the new installation.  Before calling the
.Ar diskLabelEditor
function, we simply add an additional line:
.nf
	sd0s1=/dos_c N

.fi
before the call.  This tells the label editor that you want to mount
the first slice on
.Pa /dos_c
and not to attempt to newfs it (not that
.Nm
would attempt this for a DOS partition in any case, but it could just
as easily be an existing UFS partition being named here and the 2nd
field is non-optional).
.Pp
Note:  No file system data is actually written to disk until an
explicit call to
.Ar diskLabelCommit
is made.
.It diskLabelCommit
Writes out all pending disklabel information and creates and/or mounts any
file systems which have requests pending from the
.Ar diskLabelEditor
function.
