/*
 * This file contains a UNIX domain socket communications package
 * that lets a client process send pseudo-RPCs to rpc.yppasswdd
 * without using IP. This 'local-only' communications channel is
 * only used when the superuser runs passwd(1) or chpass(1) on
 * the NIS master server. The idea is that we want to grant the
 * superuser permission to perfom certain special operations, but
 * we need an iron-clad way to tell when we're receiving a request
 * from the superuser and when we aren't. To connect to a UNIX
 * domain socket, one needs to be able to access a file in the
 * filesystem. The socket created by rpc.yppasswdd is owned by
 * root and has all its permission bits cleared, so the only
 * user who can sucessfully connect() to it is root.
 *
 * It is the server's responsibility to initialize the listening
 * socket with the makeservsock() function and to add the socket to
 * the set of file descriptors monitored by the svc_run() loop.
 * Once this is done, calls made through the UNIX domain socket
 * can be handled almost exactly like a normal RPC. We even use
 * the XDR functions for serializing data between the client and
 * server to simplify the passing of complex data structures.

 * a simple socket descriptor, but we can easily turn the latter into
 * the former using fdopen(2).
