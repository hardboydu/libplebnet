.Sh NAME
.Nm setfmac ,
.Nm setfsmac
.Nd set MAC label for a file system object
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm setfmac
.Op Fl hR
.Ar label
.Ar
.Nm setfsmac
.Op Fl ehvx
.Op Fl f Ar specfile
.Op Fl s Ar specfile
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm setfmac
utility assigns the specified MAC label to the specified files.
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl R
Set the labels on the file hierarchies rooted in the files instead of
just the files themselves.
.It Fl h
If the file is a symbolic link, change the label of the link rather
than the file that the link points to.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm setfsmac
utility accepts a list of specification files as input and sets the MAC
labels on the specified file system hierarchies.
Path names specified will be visited in order as given on the command line,
and each tree will be traversed in pre-order.
(Generally, it will not be very useful to use relative, instead of absolute,
paths.)
The labels that match a file will be combined and set in a single
transaction.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl e
Treat any file systems encountered which do not support MAC labelling as
errors, instead of warning and skipping past them.
.It Fl f Ar specfile
Add the specifications in
.Ar specfile
as a set of which at most one will be applied to each file traversed per
.Fl f Ar specfile
given.
.It Fl h
If the file is a symbolic link, change the label of the link rather
than the file that the link points to.
.It Fl s Ar specfile
Add the specification in
.Ar specfile ,
but assume that the specification format is that used in the port
of
.Tn SELinux
to
.Fx ,
.Tn SEBSD .
At most one of the specifications will be applied to each file traversed per
.Fl f Ar specfile
given.
The prefix
.Dq Li sebsd/
will automatically be prepended to the labels in this file, and labels
matching
.Dq Li <<none>>
will be explicitly not relabeled.
This permits SEBSD to re-use existing
.Tn SELinux
policy specification files
unmodified.
.It Fl v
Increase the degree of verbosity.
When given, information detailing the labelling operation is printed while
in progress.
.It Fl x
Do not cross recurse into new file systems when traversing them.
