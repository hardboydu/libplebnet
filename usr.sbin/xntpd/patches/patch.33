*** 31,36 ****
--- 31,40 ----
      For custom tailored configuration copying Config.local.dist to Config.local
      and editing Config.local to suit the local needs is neccessary (at most
      3 lines to change), or use one of the make's above and then tweak it.
+     Config.local can also be used to override common settings from the
+     machines/* files like the AUTHDEFS= to select very specific configurations.
+     Please use this feature with care and don't be disappointed if it doesn't
+     work the way you expect.
  
  (2) Type "make" to compile everything of general interest. Expect few or
      no warnings using cc and a moderate level of warnings using gcc.
