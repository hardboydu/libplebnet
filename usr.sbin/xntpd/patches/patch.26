Subject: xntpd/Makefile and 3.3l

Dave,

xntpd/Makefile doesn't get -DSYS_whatever and -DHAVE_xxx_TTYS "installed"
when the Makefile gets created.  This is for OS=mips.

Same for xntpdc/Makefile.

A patch follows...

Harlan

PS - might you have a copy of the message I sent you a couple of weeks
ago where I asked about broadcast servers and clients and the ntp.conf
file? I was going to send it to the maling list but I lost my copy.
