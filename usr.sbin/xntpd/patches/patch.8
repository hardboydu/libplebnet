Subject: Bug in export version of xntp.3.3c

Dave,

The crippled DES routine fails to compile on my machine (SunOS 1.4.3, cc).
It complains about U_LONG being unrecognized.  Luckily, the fix is a
one-liner.

*** authdes.c.export    Tue Aug 24 22:26:45 1993
--- authdes.c   Fri Jan 28 12:18:40 1994
***************
*** 15,20 ****
--- 15,21 ----
   * to its exportable state, copy this file to authdes.c .
   */
  #include <sys/types.h>
+ #include "ntp_stdlib.h"

  /*
   * This routine is normally called to compute the key schedule.
