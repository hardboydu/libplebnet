Subject: CHU debug patch

I don't know what you think about this, but I thought I'd pass it
along. I'm sorry I don't have a proper 'patch' format patch, but
it should be aparent from the context where this goes in refclock_chu.c:

		return;
	}

	/*
	 * Get the clock this applies to and a pointer to the data
	 */
	chu = (struct chuunit *)rbufp->recv_srcclock;
	chuc = (struct chucode *)&rbufp->recv_space;
	chu->responses++;
	chu->lastupdate = current_time;

	/*
	 * Just for fun, we can debug the whole frame if
	 * we want.
	 */

#ifndef NO_CHU_DEBUG
	syslog(LOG_DEBUG,"CHU %s packet:",(chuc->chutype==CHU_YEAR)?
	  "year":"time");
	for (i=0;i<NCHUCHARS;i++)
	{
		char c[64];
		
		sprintf(c,"%c%c %s",hexstring[chuc->codechars[i]&0xf],
		  hexstring[chuc->codechars[i]>>4],
		  ctime(&(chuc->codetimes[i].tv_sec)));
		c[strlen(c)-1]=0; /* ctime() adds a damn \n */
		syslog(LOG_DEBUG,"%s .%06d",c,chuc->codetimes[i].tv_usec);
	}
#endif

	/*
	 * At this point we're assured that both halves of the
	 * data match because of what the kernel has done.
