I fear not :-((

Look for a call sign I assume ....
Do I take it that they are **REQUIRED** ?  :-(((


Other problems .....

It appears that you have your own in.h in include/ntp_in.h

I suspect that that is why things are failing ...
Why not use the syatem's own in.h ??

To make it compile I added:

*** include/ntp_in.h.dist	Thu Apr 14 16:20:29 1994
--- include/ntp_in.h	Tue Apr 19 21:40:12 1994
