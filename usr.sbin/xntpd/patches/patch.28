Ok Dave, 

I guess I'll take a poke at the "m" version for cleanup and updates.  This 
should take care of the newly released 9.03 for s300/s400 which has the
adjtime(2) syscall.  Also, cleanup in readiness for 10.0 all around.

  -- Ken

P.S. How is your HP hardware/software deal going ?  I haven't heard anything
     lately.



First do a "rm */hpux10+*" as I have renamed all that to hpux-adj ... that
9.03 blew me out of the water on the naming scheme :-)

Then unshar the following ... it will add a few new files and give you 
diff to apply (diffs.hpux).

  This file hopefully describes the whatever and however of how to get xntp
! running on hpux 8.0 and later s300, s700, and s800.  
  
  First off,  all the standard disclaimers hold here ... HP doesn't have anthing
  to do with this stuff.  I fool with it in my spare time because we use it and
  because I like to.  We just happen to have a lot of HP machines around here :-)
! Xntp has been in use here for several months and has a fair amount of mileage
  on various HP platforms within the company.  I can't really guarantee bug fixes
  but I'd certainly like to hear about bugs and I won't hestitate to look at
  any fixes sent to me.  
  
! Now lets talk OS.  If you don't have 8.0 or later, pretty much hang it up now.
! This stuff has run here on 8.0 s300, s700, and s800.  Its possible that it 
! runs on 7.0 but I have not tried v3 code on 7.0 at all.
  
! [Note that recent reports state that this release does in fact run on HP
! 300 and 400 boxes, which run 7.0 - Ed.]
  
! Next, let me explain a bit about how this stuff works on HP-UX since we don't
  have adjtime(2).  The directory adjtime contains libadjtime.a and the adjtimed
  daemon.  Instead of the adjtime(2) system call, we use a library routine to
  talk to adjtimed thru message queues.  Adjtimed munges into /dev/kmem and
  causes the clock to skew properly as needed.  PLEASE NOTE that the adjtime
  code provided here is NOT a general replacement for adjtime(2) ... use of
! this adjtime(3)/adjtimed(8) other than here may yield very odd results.
  
  What to do to get this stuff running ?
  
!     * cd ..
! 	* Say "make makeconfig"
  
!     * cd ..
! 	* Say "make", sit back for a few minutes.
  
      * cd authstuff
  	* Say "./authcert < certdata" and check the output.  Every line should
  	  end with "OK" ... if not, we got trouble.
  	* Now try "./authspeed auth.samplekeys".  What we want to 
  	  remember here is the "authentication delay in CPU time" 
  
!     * cd ..
! 	* Now we need to install this stuff ... make install will not work
! 	  unless you have replaced the SYSV install command with a BSD
! 	  compatible version.  So ... the simplest thing to do is run
! 	  make -n install and do manually what it would have done.
  
      * I'd suggest reading the xntp docs about now :-) ... seriously !!
  
!     * Check out the docs and the stuff in xntp/conf and build a config
!       file ... put it in /usr/local/etc/xntp.conf (or where ever you
!       defined the config file to be in Config).  One thing we have 
!       added to this version of xntpd is a way to select config files
!       if you are sharing /usr/local thru NFS or whatever.  If the 
!       file /usr/local/etc/xntp.conf happens to be a directory, the files
!       in that directory are searched until a match is found.  The rules
!       for a match are:
  
  	1. Our hostname
  	2. default.<machine id> (as in default.375 or default.850)

! from the field and not my personal experience.
  
! If you are lucky enough to have a s300 or s400 with 9.03, then you no longer
! have to worry about adjtimed as HP-UX now has adjtime(2).  The rest of you
! will have to wait on 10.0 which will have adjtime(2) and a supported though

!     * If you are running an OS less than 10.0 or do not have a s300/s400 
!       with 9.03 or better
! 	-> cd machines
! 	-> vi hpux
! 	-> (change -DSYS_HPUX=? to match whatever you are running [7,8,9])
! 	-> cd ..

***************
*** 72,76 ****
--- 76,92 ----
  
      * On some 320's and 835's we have had to run adjtimed with "-p 45" or
        so to get rid of syslog messages about "last adjust did not finish".
+ 
+     * At 9.0, there is a problem with DIAGMON (patch available from the
+       response center) which causes it to delete the message queue that
+       adjtimed/xntpd use to communicate. (see next note for result)
+ 
+     * Xntpd has been known to get really ticked off when adjtime() fails
+       which is usually only while running the emulation code on HP-UX.
+       When it gets mad, it usually jumps the clock into never never land.
+       Possible reasons for this are adjtimed being killed or just never
+       started or adjtimed being completely swapped out on a really busy
+       machine (newer adjtimed try to lock themselves in memory to prevent
+       this one).
