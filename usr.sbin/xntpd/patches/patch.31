Hi, Dave,

I just got through manually read news (in the spool area 8-( - when
will they ever fix our news installation).

In order to avoid ptx being picked up in AT&T machine i added hope-fully
an additional check. Why do vendor have to make machine look the
same when they aren't ? I though uname was supposed to find out - I
guess I was wrong - every vendor seems to have his own ideas about
uname and they all do not mix very well. 

The fix to numtohost allows it to compile on ptx - I hope it still
compiles on all others (should though).
