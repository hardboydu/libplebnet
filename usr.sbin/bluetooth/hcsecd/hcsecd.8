.Nd control link keys and PIN codes for Bluetooth devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f Ar configfile
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon controls link keys and PIN code for Bluetooth devices. It opens raw 
HCI socket and listens for the
.Dv Link_Key_Request
and
.Dv PIN_Code_Request
HCI events. Once appropriate HCI event has been received, the daemon will 
scan configuration file for matching entry. The remove device BD_ADDR is used 
as a key. If no matching entry was found then the default entry will be used.
If no default entry was found than it is assumed no link key and no PIN code 
exist. For any given entry link key takes precedence over PIN code. If link key
was not specified then it means device must generate link key from PIN code. If
entry was found and has the link key (or PIN code) then
the
.Dv Link_Key_Request_Reply
(or
.Dv PIN_Code_Request_Reply
) command will be sent back to the device. Otherwise the
.Dv Link_Key_Request_Negative_Reply
(or
.Dv PIN_Code_Request_Negative_Reply
) command will be sent back to the device.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon currently does not handle HCI
.Dv Link_Key_Notification 
event and does not cache link keys created from the PIN codes. It means
that the link key only exists while connection is opened. After the connection
has been terminated the user will have to enter PIN code again.
.Pp
The command line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar filename
Name of configuration file. Default is 
.Pa /usr/local/etc/hcsecd.conf .
.It Fl d
Do not detach from the controlling terminal.
.It Fl h
Display usage message and exit.
.El
.Sh BUGS
Currently there is no way to select link key or PIN code based on which local 
device received the request. Everything is based on remote device BD_ADDR.
Also might implement interface for external helpers to obtain link keys and 
PIN codes.
