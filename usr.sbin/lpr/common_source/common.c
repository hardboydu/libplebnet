	 *   <n>           - file count (# of file within job)
	 *   <rectype>     - 4-byte field indicating the type of transfer
	 *		     statistics record.  "send" means it's from the
	 *		     host sending a datafile, "recv" means it's from
	 *		     a host as it receives a datafile.
	 *   user=<userid> - user who sent the job (if known)
	 *   secs=<n>      - seconds it took to transfer the file
	 *   bytes=<n>     - number of bytes transfered (ie, "bytecount")
	 *   bps=<n.n>e<n> - Bytes/sec (if the transfer was "big enough"
	 *		     for this to be useful) 
	 * ! top=<str>     - type of printer (if the type is defined in
	 *		     printcap, and if this statline is for sending
	 *		     a file to that ptr)
	 * ! qls=<n>       - queue-length at start of send/print-ing a job
	 * ! qle=<n>       - queue-length at end of send/print-ing a job
	 *   sip=<addr>    - IP address of sending host, only included when
	 *		     receiving a job.
	 *   shost=<hname> - sending host (if that does != the original host)
	 *   rhost=<hname> - hostname receiving the file (ie, "destination")
	 *   rdev=<dev>    - device receiving the file, when the file is being
	 *		     send to a device instead of a remote host.
	 *
	 * Note: A single print job may be transferred multiple times.  The
	 * original 'lpr' occurs on one host, and that original host might
	 * send to some interim host (or print server).  That interim host
	 * might turn around and send the job to yet another host (most likely
	 * the real printer).  The 'shost=' parameter is only included if the
	 * sending host for this particular transfer is NOT the same as the
	 * host which did the original 'lpr'.
	 *
	 * Many values have 'something=' tags before them, because they are
	 * in some sense "optional", or their order may vary.  "Optional" may
	 * mean in the sense that different SITES might choose to have other
	 * fields in the record, or that some fields are only included under
	 * some circumstances.  Programs processing these records should not
	 * assume the order or existence of any of these keyword fields.
