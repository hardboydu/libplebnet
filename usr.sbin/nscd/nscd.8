.Sh NAME
.Nm cached
.Nd caching server daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl nst
.Op Fl i Ar cachename
.Op Fl I Ar cachename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
- is the system caching daemon.
It can cache almost all types of data and is basically intended to be used
with
.Pa nsswitch
subsystem.
The cache is actually per-user. It means that each user can work only with the
cached data, that were cached by him and can't poison the cache of other users.
.Nm
supports 2 types of caching:
.Bl -tag -width Pair
.It Sy Type
.Sy Description
.It Common caching
Each cached element is the the key+value pair.
This type of caching supports policies, which are applied, when maximum
number of cached elements is exceeded.
3 policies are available:
.Pa FIFO
(first in - first out),
.Pa LRU
(least recently used) and
.Pa LFU
(least frequently used).
This type of caching is used with
.Fn getXXXbyname
- like functions.
.It Multipart caching
Each cached element is the part of the elements sequence.
This type of caching is intended to be used with
.Fn getXXXent
- like functions.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
is able not only to cache elements, but to perform the actual nsswitch
lookups by itself. To enable this feature use
.Pa perform-actual-lookups
parameter in the
.Xr cached.conf 5
.Pp
.Nm
recognizes the following runtime options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n
Do not daemonize.
.Nm
doesn't fork and doesn't disconnect itself from the terminal.
.It Fl s
Single-threaded mode.
Forces using only one thread for all processing purposes (it overrides
the
.Pa threads
parameter in the
.Xr cached.conf 5
file).
.It Fl t
Trace mode.
All trace messages would be written to the stdout.
This mode is usually used with
.Fl n
and
.Fl s
flags for debugging purposes.
.It Fl i Ar cachename
Invalidates personal cache. When specified,
.Nm
acts as the administration tool. It asks the already
running
.Nm
to invalidate the specified part of the cache of the
calling user. For example, you may want sometimes
to invalidate your
.Pa hosts
cache. You can specify
.Pa all
as the
.Pa cachename
to invalidate your personal cache as a whole. You
can't use this option for the cachename, for which
the
.Pa perform-actual-lookups
option is enabled.
.It Fl I Ar cachename
Invalidates the cache for every user. When specified,
.Nm
acts as the administration tool. It asks the already
running
.Nm
to invalidate the specified part of the cache for
every user. You can specify
.Pa all
as the
.Pa cachename
to invalidate the whole cache. Only root can use this
option.
