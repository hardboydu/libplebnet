.Sh NAME
.Nm apm, zzz
.Nd control the APM BIOS and display its information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm apm
.Op Fl ablstzZ
.Op Fl d Ar 1|0
.Op Fl r Ar delta
.Pp
.Nm zzz
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Apm
controls the Intel / Microsoft APM (Advanced Power Management) BIOS and 
displays the current status of APM on laptop PCs.
.Nm Zzz 
suspends the system by controlling APM.
.Pp
The following options are available for 
.Nm apm
(no options are available for
.Nm zzz
).
If no options are specified,
.Nm apm
displays information and current status of APM in verbose mode.
If multiple display options are given, the values are displayed one
per line in the order given here.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Display the current AC-line status as an integer value.  The values
0 and 1 correspond to the 
.Dq off-line
state or
.Dq on-line
state, respectively.
.It Fl b
Display an integer value reflecting the current battery status.
The values 0, 1, 2, 3, correspond to the 
.Dq high
status, 
.Dq low
status, 
.Dq critical
status,
.Dq charging
status respectively.
.It Fl d
Disable/enable suspending of the display separately from a normal suspend
using the values
.Ar 1
or
.Ar 0
respectively.  This argument seems to not work on many different
laptops, including the Libretto 30CT and 50CT.
.It Fl l
Display the remaining battery percentage.  If your laptop does not 
support this function, 255 is displayed.
.It Fl r
Enable the resume wakeup timer, if the laptop supports it.  This
doesn't actually suspend the laptop, but if the laptop is suspended,
and it supports resume from suspend, then it will be resume after
.Ar delta
seconds (from when you run this command, not from when you suspend).
.It Fl s
Display the status of the APM support as an integer value.  The values
0 and 1 correspond to the
.Dq disabled
state or
.Dq enabled
state respectively.
.It Fl t
Display the estimated remaining battery lifetime in seconds.  If
it is unknown, -1 is displayed.
.It Fl Z
Transition the system into standby mode.  This mode uses less power than
full power mode, but more than suspend mode.  Some laptops support
resuming from this state on timer or Ring Indicator events.  The
output of apm tells what your laptop claims to support.
.It Fl z
Suspend the system. It is equivalent to
.Nm zzz .
.El
.Sh BUGS
Some APM implementations do not support parameters needed by
.Nm apm .
On such systems,
.Nm apm
displays them as unknown.
.Pp
Some APM implementations cannot handle events such as pushing the 
power button or closing the cover.  On such implementations, the system
.Ar must
be suspended
.Ar only
by using
.Nm apm
or 
.Nm zzz .
