kldxref(8) used to generate linker.hints file which contains list of
modules, their version numbers and container KLDs. This file used by loader
and kernel linker.

Each directory with KLDs should have its own linker.hints file.

Typical invocation of kldxref utility may look like this:

kldxref /boot/kernel /modules

which will build hints file in both directories.

A recursive behaviour can be specified with -R option:

kldxref /boot

If no hint records written, hints file will not be created and old file
will be removed.

If -d flag specified then no files generated and program prints metadata
records to stdout.
