.Sh NAME
.Nm ndiscvt
.Nd Convert Windows(r) NDIS drivers for use with FreeBSD
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl i Ar <inffile>
.Fl s Ar <sysfile>
.Op Fl o Ar <outfile>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility transforms a Windows(r) NDIS driver into a data file which
is used to build an
.Xr ndis 4
compatibility driver module. Windows(r) drivers consist of two main
parts: a .SYS file, which contains the actual driver executable code,
and a .INF file, which provides the Windows(r) installer with device
identifier information and a list of driver-specific registry keys.
The
.Nm
utility can convert these files into a header file that is compiled
intoe
.Pa if_ndis.c
to create an object code module that can be linked into
the
.Fx
kernel.
.Pp
The .INF file is typically required since only it contains device
identification data such as PCI vendor and device IDs or PCMCIA
indentifier strings. The .INF file may be optionally omitted however,
in which case the
.Nm
utility will only perform the conversion of the .SYS file. This is
useful for debugging purposes only.
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Op Fl i Ar <inffile>
Open and parse the specified .INF file when performing conversion.
The
.Nm
utility will parse this file and emit a device identification
structure and registry key configuration structures which will be
used by the
.Xr ndis 4
driver and
.Xr ndisapi 9
kernel subsystem.
If this is omitted,
.Nm
will emit a dummy configuration structure only.
.It Fl s Ar <sysfile>
Open and parse the specified .SYS file. This file must contain
a Windows(r) driver image. The
.Nm
utility will perform some manipulation of the sections within the
executable file to make runtime linking within the kernel a little
easier and then convert the image into a data array.
.It Op Fl o Ar <outfile>
Specify the output file in which to place the resulting data. This
can be any file pathname. If
.Ar <outfile>
is a single dash, the data will be written to the standard output.
The
.Pa if_ndis.c
module expects to find the driver data in a file called
.Pa ndis_driver_data.h ,
so it is recommended that this name be used.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ndis 4 ,
.Xr ndisapi 9
.Sh BUGS
Some Windows(r) drivers support multiple devices which each may
require sets of registry keys. The .INF file format allows all of
these devices to be supported in a single file. The
.Nm
utility will emit keys for all of the devices that it are specified
in a given file, even if this results in some duplicated entries.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Fx 5.3.
