.Dt DISKCHECKD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm diskcheckd
.Nd daemon to check for disk read errors
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl f Ar conf_file
.Op Fl o Ar save_file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon which runs in the background,
reading entire disks to find any read errors on those disks.
The disks which should be scanned,
and the rates at which they should be scanned,
must be specified in the configuration file,
which is
.Pa /etc/diskcheckd.conf
by default.
.Pp
Any blank lines or lines starting with a
.Ql #
character in this file are ignored.
Each non-comment line of this file should contain four white space separated
fields,
which are the full pathname of the disk device,
the size of that disk,
the frequency in days at which to check that disk,
and the rate in kilobytes per second at which to check this disk.
Naturally,
it would be contradictory to specify both the frequency and the rate,
so only one of these should be specified.
Additionally,
the size of the disk should not be specified if the rate is specified,
as this information is unnecessary.
.Pp
If the disk is specified as
.Dq * ,
then
.Nm
will apply the given settings to all disks in the system,
obtained using the
.Va kern.disks
sysctl variable.
If the size is specified as
.Dq *
(recommended),
then the size of the disk will be automatically determined from the
disklabel,
if possible.
Fields which are not specified should contain a single
.Dq *
character.
.Pp
Note that any rate specified will be rounded to the nearest power of 2,
and will be forced into the range 512 bytes to 128 kilobytes,
inclusive.
Any rate calculated from the frequency and size information will be rounded
in the same way,
so if you specify the third field (days for complete scan) it is unlikely
that a complete scan will actually take exactly this many days.
.Pp
To run
.Nm
automatically at boot time,
the
.Va diskcheckd_enable
variable in
.Xr rc.conf 5
should be set to
.Dq YES .
.Pp
When
.Nm
receives a
.Dv SIGTERM
or
.Dv SIGINT
signal,
it saves its current state information to a file,
so that after a reboot
.Nm
can resume reading from where it left off,
rather than starting from the beginning of the disk again.
The information saved to this file consists of the device filename and the
current offset into that device.
.Pp
.Nm
can be instructed to reload the configuration file by sending it a
.Dv SIGHUP
signal.
.Pp
.Nm
accepts the following command line options:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl d
If this flag is specified,
.Nm
will not fork into the background and detach from its controlling terminal
to become a daemon.
This flag is primarily used for debugging.
.It Fl f
Specify the configuration file to use,
instead of the default
.Pa /etc/diskcheckd.conf .
.It Fl o
Specify the file to save disk offsets to,
instead of the default
.Pa /var/db/diskcheckd.offsets .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/db/diskcheckd.offsets -compact
.It Pa /etc/diskcheckd.conf
Default configuration file.
.It Pa /var/db/diskcheckd.offsets
Default location of saved offsets.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To check all of
.Pa /dev/ad0
for errors once every two weeks,
use this entry in
.Pa diskcheckd.conf :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/dev/ad0	*	14	*
.Ed
.Pp
To check the first SCSI disk for errors at approximately 64KB/s,
use the following entry:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/dev/da0	*	*	64
.Ed
.Pp
To check all disks once every four weeks:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
*	*	28	*
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If any errors occur,
they will be written to
.Xr syslogd 8 .
