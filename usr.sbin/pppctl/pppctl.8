.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program provides command line control of the
.Nm ppp
daemon.  Its primary use is to facilitate simple scripts that
control a running daemon.

.Nm Pppctl
expects at least two arguments.  The first is interpreted as the
socket on which the
.Nm ppp
daemon is listening.  If the socket contains a leading '/', it
is taken as an AF_LOCAL socket.  If it consists entirely of numbers,
it is interpreted as a TCP port number on localhost.  If it contains
any characters, the first of which is not a '/' character, it is
interpreted as an entry of type "tcp" from
.Pa /etc/services .
All remaining arguments are concatenated to form the command(s) that
will be sent to the
.Nm ppp
daemon.  If any semi-colon characters are found, they are treated
as command delimiters, allowing more than one command in a given
"session".  For example;

  pppctl 3000 set timeout 300\\; show timeout

Don't forget to escape or quote the ';' as it is a special character
for most shells.

The following command line options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl v
Display all data sent to and received from the
.Nm ppp
daemon.  Normally,
.Nm pppctl
displays only non-prompt lines received.
.It Fl t Ar n
Use a timeout of
.Ar n
instead of the default 2 seconds.  This may be required if you
wish to control a daemon over a slow (or even a dialup) link.
.It Fl p Ar passwd
Specify the password required by the
.Nm ppp
daemon.  If this switch is not used,
.Nm
will prompt for a password once it has successfully connected to
.Nm ppp
(assuming, of course, that one is required).
