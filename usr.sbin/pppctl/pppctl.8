.Sh NAME
.Nm pppctl
.Nd
PPP control program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl t Ar n
.Op Fl p Ar passwd
.Ar [host:]Port | LocalSocket
.Ar command
.Op Ar ;command
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program provides command line control of the
.Nm ppp
daemon.  Its primary use is to facilitate simple scripts that
control a running daemon.

.Nm Pppctl
expects at least two arguments.  The first is interpreted as the
socket on which the
.Nm ppp
daemon is listening.  If the socket contains a leading '/', it
is taken as an AF_LOCAL socket.  If it contains a colon, it is
treated as a host:port pair, otherwise it is treated as just a
port specification on the local machine (127.0.0.1).  Both the
host and port may be specified numerically if you wish to avoid
a DNS lookup or don't have an entry for the given port in
.Pa /etc/services .

.Pp
All remaining arguments are concatenated to form the command(s) that
will be sent to the
.Nm ppp
daemon.  If any semi-colon characters are found, they are treated
as command delimiters, allowing more than one command in a given
"session".  For example;

  pppctl 3000 set timeout 300\\; show timeout

Don't forget to escape or quote the ';' as it is a special character
for most shells.

The following command line options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl v
Display all data sent to and received from the
.Nm ppp
daemon.  Normally,
.Nm pppctl
displays only non-prompt lines received.
.It Fl t Ar n
Use a timeout of
.Ar n
instead of the default 2 seconds.  This may be required if you
wish to control a daemon over a slow (or even a dialup) link.
.It Fl p Ar passwd
Specify the password required by the
.Nm ppp
daemon.  If this switch is not used,
.Nm
will prompt for a password once it has successfully connected to
.Nm ppp
(assuming, of course, that one is required).
