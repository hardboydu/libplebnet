.Sh NAME
.Nm isdnd.rc
.Nd isdn4bsd ISDN connection management daemon config file format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /etc/isdn/isdnd.rc
contains (if not otherwise specified on the command line) the runtime
configuration for the 
.Xr isdnd 8
ISDN connection management daemon which is part of the isdn4bsd package.
.Pp
The configuration file consists of keywords which start in column 1 followed by
one or more spaces or tabs, an equal sign, one or more spaces or tabs
and a keyword dependent parameter value.
.Pp
A line beginning with '#' is treated as a comment line.
.Pp
For keywords requiring the specification of a boolean value, the truth
value can be either
.Em yes
or
.Em on
while the false value can be either
.Em no
or
.Em off .
.Pp
The configuration file consists of one
.Em system
section and one or more
.Em entry
sections.
In the
.Em system
section parameters regarding the daemon operation or parameters 
not associated with a single remote connection can be set.
In the
.Em entry
section(s) parameters directly associated with a single remote
connection can be set.
.Pp
The following keywords are recognized by
.Nm isdnd :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width system -compact

.It Li system
This keyword starts the system configuration section. It must not 
have a parameter and may be used only once. The keyword is mandatory.

us back.

.It Li dialrandincr
When dialing or re-dialing and this parameter is set to

A delay value suitable for the
.Em timeout()
kernel subroutine to delay the transmittion of the first packet after a
successfull connection is made by this value for 
.Em outgoing
ISDN connections. The specification unit is 1/100 second. A zero (0) disables   
this feature and is the default value. This feature is implemented (and makes
sense only) for the
.Xr i4bipr 4
IP over raw HDLC ISDN driver. (optional)

.Pp
This keyword is mandatory for the
.Em ipr
interfaces. It may be specified more than once to try to dial to several
numbers until one succeeds.

.It Li remote-phone-incoming
The remote telephone number used to verify an incoming call. When a remote site
dials in, this number is used to verify that it is the correct remote site
which is herewith authorized to connect into the local system. This parameter
is compared against the 
.Em "Calling Party Number Information Element"
got from the telephone exchange.
.Pp
This keyword is mandatory for the ipr interfaces.
.Pp
This keyword may have a wildcard parameter '*' to permit anyone dialing in.

.It Li unitlength
The length of a charging unit in seconds. This is used in conjunction with
the idletime to decide when to hangup a connection. (optional)

Use a dynamically calculated unitlength in case AOCD is subscribed on
the ISDN line. (AOCD is an acronym for ``Advice Of Charge During the call''
which is a service provided by the telecommunications (ie phone) provider,
to indicate billable units).
.El

.It Li usrdevicename
Specifies the userland interface which is used for interfacing ISDN B channel
data to the userland. The keyword is mandatory.
This keyword accepts the following parameters:

.It Ar tel
ISDN telephony.
.El

.It Li usrdeviceunit
Specifies the unit number for the device which is specified with
usrdevicename.

.It Li usedown
is used to enable the use of the keywords
.Em downtries
and
.Em downtime
in the entries section(s). It is used in the
.Nm isdnd
daemon to dynamically enable and disable the IP interfaces to avoid excessive
dialing activities in case of transient failures (such as busy lines).
This parameter is optional and is set to
.Em off
by default.

.It Li connectprog

(optional, only if it can be figured out by isdnd). (optional)

.It Li disconnectprog
specifies a program run everytime after a connection was shut down.
.Nm Isdnd
expects to find the program below the path
.Pa /etc/isdn
which is prepended to the string specified as a parameter to this keyword.
(optional)

.El
.El

.Sh IDLETIME CALCULATION AND SHORTHOLD MODE
.Bl -tag -width incoming calls -compact
.It Li incoming calls
It is assumed that the calling side knows most about charging structures and
such and as a consequence only the keyword
.Em idletime-incoming
has a function for incoming calls.
.Pp
For incoming calls the line is constantly monitored, and in case there was
not traffic taking place for the time in seconds specified by
.Em idletime-incoming
the call is closed.
.Pp
Typically,
.Em idletime-incoming
is used as a last resort and is therefore set much higher than a charging
unit time: typical values are one to five minutes.

.It Li outgoing calls
Outgoing call disconnect time can be setup in one of three ways:

.Bl -tag -width shorthold mode -compact
.It Li simple mode
For simple mode, the 
.Em idle-algorithm-outgoing
must be
.Em fix-unit-size
and the selected
.Em unitlength
must be 0 (zero) and
.Em idletime-outgoing
greater zero. 
.Pp
The outgoing traffic is constantly monitored, and in case there was
not traffic taking place for the time in seconds specified by
.Em idletime-outgoing
the call is closed.
.Pp
Typical values in simple mode are 10 to 30 seconds.

.It Li shorthold mode for fixed unit charging
For shorthold mode, the 
.Em idle-algorithm-outgoing
 must be
.Em fix-unit-size
 and the selected
.Em unitlength 
and 
.Em idletime-outgoing
must be greater than 0 (zero);
.Em earlyhangup must be >= 0 (zero).

.Bd -literal

|<unchecked-window>|<checkwindow>|<safetywindow>|
|                  |             |              |
+------------------+-------------+--------------+
|                  |             |              |
|                  |<-idle-time->|<earlyhangup->|
|<--------------unitlength--------------------->|

.Ed

During the unchecked window which is (unitlength - (idle-time+earlyhangup))
in length, no idle check is done. After the unchecked window has ended,
the line is checked for idle-time length if no traffic takes place. In case
there was traffic detected in the check-window, the same procedure is restarted
at the beginning of the next unit. In case no traffic was detected during
the check-window, the line is closed at the end of the check window.
.Pp
Notice: 
.Em unitlength
must (!) be greater than the sum of
.Em idletime-outgoing
and
.Em earlyhangup !

.It Li shorthold mode for variable unit charging
For shorthold mode, the 
.Em idle-algorithm-outgoing
must be
.Em var-unit-size
and the selected
.Em unitlength 
and
.Em idletime-outgoing
must be greater than 0 (zero);
.Pp

This shorthold mode is suitable when your calls are billed on
the elapse time of the call plus a fixed connection charge.
For example British Telecom bill this way.
.Pp

Each call is divided into two periods, the first is the
.Em unchecked
period and the second is the
.Em checked
. The
.Em checked
period starts 1 second before the first units time expires.
.Pp
During the
.Em checked
period if there is no traffic for
.Em idle-time
seconds the call is disconnected.
.Pp

.Bd -literal

|<---unchecked------------------>|<------checked------>
+------------------+-------------+
|                  |<-idle-time->|
|<--------------unitlength------->|

.Ed

Experience shows that useful values for idle-time are from 15 to 30 seconds.
.Pp
If idle-time is too short an application that is not yet finished with the
network will cause a new call to be placed.
