.Sh NAME
.Nm isdntest
.Nd isdn4bsd debugging and verification tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c Ar unit
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl i Ar number
.Op Fl o Ar number
.Op Fl w
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm isdntest
is part of the isdn4bsd package and may be used as a stimulation tool
for debugging the isdn4bsd kernel functionality.
.Pp
NOTE: 
.Nm Isdntest
must be run
.Em instead
of the
.Xr isdnd 8
daemon and can not be used while the daemon runs.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Use controller unit number for test.
.It Fl h
Use HDLC as the B channel layer 1 protocol instead of no protocol.
.It Fl i
Use number to verify the incoming number.
.It Fl o
Use number as the outgoing number to dial.
.It Fl w
Wait for keyboard input for terminating the call.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is currently of not much use for end users, it is primarily a debugging
tool for development and is part of the release in the hope, that someone
enhances it as a real self test and setup-verification tool!
.Pp
.Nm Isdntest 
does almost no error checking and error recovery, so unexpected
hangs or crashes may occur.

.Sh EXAMPLES
For the following example, it is assumed that a machine with isdn4bsd 
installed is connected to an S0 bus and that one of the valid MSN's (MSN = Multiple Subscriber Number
= telephone number) on this bus is
.Em 42 .
The 
.Xr isdnd 8
.Em must
not currently running on that machine! Executing:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
isdntest -i 42 -o 42
.Ed
.Pp
will setup an outgoing call from that machine to itself, connect to itself
and disconnect after 5 seconds.
.Nm Isdntest
has to be finished by the user by entering Control-C.
