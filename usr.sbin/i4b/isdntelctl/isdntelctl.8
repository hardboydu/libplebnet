.Sh NAME
.Nm isdntelctl
.Nd control isdn4bsd telephone sound format conversion
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl g
.Op Fl u Ar unit
.Op Fl A

.Op Fl R
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm isdntelctl
is part of the isdn4bsd package and is used to configure the sound format
conversion facilities of the /dev/i4btel interfaces.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Clear the telephone input queue.
.It Fl g
Get the sound format currently in use.
.It Fl u
Set the /dev/i4btel unit number. The default value is zero to access
device /dev/i4btel0.
.It Fl A
Set sound format to A-Law.
.It Fl U
Set sound format to u-Law.
.It Fl R
Set sound format to canonical (regular) A-Law format.
.El
.Pp
By default, isdn4bsd sends and receives audio in A-Law as provided by the
hardware. However, these samples cannot easily be processed further as the
sample word is bit-reversed. Both the u-Law and canonical A-Law formats
store samples in a way suitable for post-processing by e.\ g. sox(1).
.Pp
.Sh FILES
/dev/i4btel<n>

.Sh STANDARDS
A-Law and u-Law are specified in ITU Recommendation G.711.

.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
isdntelctl -g
.Ed
.Pp
displays the currently used sound format for device /dev/i4btel0.

.Sh AUTHOR
The
.Nm
utility and this manpage were written by Hellmuth Michaelis. He can be
