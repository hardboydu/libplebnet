.Sh BUGS
.Nm qcamcontrol
does not enforce a proper aspect ratio for x y sizes.
In practice, standard picture sizes are 320x240 and 180x160 and all smaller
sizes that maintain a similar aspect ratio.
Also, the camera is notoriously finicky until you get just the right
combination of white-balance, contrast, and brightness.  Improper values
will return all-black or all-white pictures.
