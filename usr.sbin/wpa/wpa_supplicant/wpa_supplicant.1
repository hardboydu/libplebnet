.Sh NAME
.Nm wpa_supplicant
.Nd "WPA/802.11i Supplicant for wireless network devices"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl BddehLqqvw
.Fl i Ar ifname
.Fl c Ar config-file
.Op Fl N i Ar ifname Fl c Ar config-file ....
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an implementation of the WPA Supplicant component,
i.e., the part that runs in the client stations.
It implements WPA key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator
and EAP authentication with Authentication Server.
In addition, it controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11
authentication/association of the wlan driver.
.Pp
.Nm
is designed to be a "daemon" program that runs in the
background and acts as the backend component controlling
the wireless connection.
.Nm
supports separate frontend programs such as the
text-based frontend,
.Xr wpa_cli 8
.Pp
The following arguments must be specified on the command line:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl i Ar ifname
Use the specified wireless interface.
.It Fl c Ar config-file
Use the settings in the specified configuration file when managing 
the specified wireless interface.
See 
.Xr wpa_supplicant.conf 5
for a description of the configuration file syntax.
.Pp
Changes to the configuration file can be reloaded by sending a 
.Nm SIGHUP
to the
.Nm
processor or with the
.Xr wpa_cli
utility, using ``wpa_cli reconfigure''.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Enable debugging messages.
If this option is supplied twice more verbose messages are displayed.
.It Fl e
Use an external IEEE 802.1X Supplicant program and disable the
internal Supplicant.
This option is not normally used.
.It Fl h
Show help text.
.It Fl q
Decrease debugging verbosity (i.e. counteract the use of the
.Fl d
flag.
.It Fl v
Display version information on the terminal and exit.
.It Fl w
If the specified interface is not present, wait for it to be
added; e.g. a cardbus device to be inserted.
.It Fl B
Detach from the controlling terminal and run as a daemon process
in the background.
.It Fl K
Include key information in debugging output.
.It Fl L
Display the license for this program on the terminal and exit.
.It Fl N Fl i Ar iface Fl Ar config-file
Specify an additional interface and configuration file.
If multiple interfaces are specified then
.Nm
will manage them all with a single process.
