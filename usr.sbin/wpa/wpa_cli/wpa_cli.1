.Sh NAME
.Nm wpa_cli
.Nd "text-based frontend program for interacting with wpa_supplicant"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op commands
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a text-based frontend program for interacting with
.Xr wpa_supplicant 1.
.Nm
is used to query current status,
change configuration,
trigger events,
and
request interactive user input.
.Pp
.Nm
can show the
current authentication status,
selected security
mode, dot11 and dot1x MIBs, etc.
In addition, 
.Nm
can configure EAPOL state machine
parameters and trigger events like reassociation
and IEEE 802.1X logoff/logon.
.Nm
provides a user interface to request authentication information,
like username and password, if these are not included in the
configuration.
This can be used to implement,
e.g., one-time-passwords or generic token card
authentication where the authentication is based on a
challenge-response that uses an external device for generating the
response.
.Pp
The control interface of
.Nm wpa_supplicant
can be configured to allow
non-root user access (ctrl_interface_group in the configuration file).
This makes it possible to run 
.Nm
with a normal user account.
.Pp
.Nm
supports two modes: interactive and command line.
Both modes share the same command set and the main difference
is in interactive mode providing access to unsolicited messages
(event messages, username/password requests).
.Pp
Interactive mode is started when
.Nm
is executed without with any parameters on the command line.
Commands are then entered from the controlling terminal in
response to the
.Nm
prompt.
In command line mode, the same commands are
entered as command line arguments.
.Sh AUTHENTICATION PARAMETERS
.Pp
When
.Nm wpa_supplicant
needs authentication parameters, such as username and password,
that are not present in the configuration file, it sends a
request message to all attached frontend programs, e.g., 
.Nm
in interactive mode.
.Nm
shows these requests with
"CTRL-REQ-<type>-<id>:<text>" prefix.
<type> is IDENTITY, PASSWORD, or OTP (one-time-password).
<id> is a unique identifier for the current network.
<text> is description of the request.
In case of OTP request, it includes the challenge from
the authentication server.
.Pp
A user must supply 
.Nm wpa_supplicant
the needed parameters in response to these requests.
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal
CTRL-REQ-PASSWORD-1:Password needed for SSID foobar
> password 1 mysecretpassword

Example request for generic token card challenge-response:

CTRL-REQ-OTP-2:Challenge 1235663 needed for SSID foobar
> otp 2 9876
.Ed
.Sh COMMANDS
The following commands may be supplied on the command line
or at a prompt when operating interactively.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It status
Report the current WPA/EAPOL/EAP status for the current interface.
.It mib
Report MIB variables (dot1x, dot11) for the current interface.
.It help
Show usage help.
.It interface [ Ar ifname ]
Show available interfaces and/or set the current interface
when multiple are available.
.It level <debug level>
Change the debugging level in
.Nm wpa_supplicant .
Larger numbers generate more messages.
.It license
Display the full
.Nm
license for
.Nm .
.It logoff
Send the IEEE 802.1X EAPOL state machine into the logoff state.
.It logon
Send the IEEE 802.1X EAPOL state machine into the logon state.
.It set [ settings ]
Set variables.
When no arguments are supplied the known variables and their settings
are displayed.
.It pmksa
Show the contents of the PMKSA cache.
.It reassociate
Force a reassociation to the current access point.
.It reconfigure
Force 
.Nm
to re-read its configuration file.
.It preauthenticate <BSSID>
Force preauthentication of the specified BSSID.
.It identity <network id> <identity>
Configure an identity for an SSID.
.It password <network id> <password>
Configure a password for an SSID.
.It otp <network id> <password>
Configure a one-time-password for an SSID.
.It terminate
Force
.Nm wpa_supplicant
to terminate.
.It quit
Exit
.Nm .
