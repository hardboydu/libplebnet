.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "bootparamd daemon" "" "\fLbootparamd\fP daemon"
.LP
.B bootparamd
is a server process that provides information to diskless clients
necessary for booting. It consults 
.B /etc/bootparams
file. 
.LP
This version will allow the use of aliases on the hostname in the
.B /etc/bootparams
file. The returned hostname to the whoami request done by the booting client
will be the name that appears in 
.B /etc/bootparams
and not the canonical name. In this way you can keep the answer short enough
so that machines that can not handle long hostnames won't fail during boot.
