.SH NAME
vidcontrol - a utility for manipulating the syscons video driver.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.B vidcontrol
.RB [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B vidcontrol
command is used to set various options for the syscons video driver,
such as video mode, colors, cursor, scrnmaps, font and screensaver timeout.

A new video mode is selected by specifying its name as an argument to
.B vidcontrol
eg. "
.B vidcontrol VGA_80x25 
". 

The modes currently supported: VGA_40x25, VGA_80x25, VGA_80x50, EGA_80x25, EGA_80x43.
On some laptops the modes VGA_80x30 and VGA_80x60 can be used.
The graphic mode VGA_320x200 can also be chosen.

The colors used when displaying text can be changed by specifying the 
foreground color (eg. "
.B vidcontrol white
"), or both a foreground & background
color (eg. "
.B vidcontrol yellow blue
").

To see the supported colors on a given platform use "
.B vidcontrol show
".
