PCMCIA Support for FreeBSD 2.0
------------------------------

This package contains the following:

	- Driver for Intel 83265 PCIC PCMCIA controller
	- A PCMCIA daemon for managing card insertions/removals
	- Diffs to various source files for adding PCMCIA support
	- A sample config file
	- Some utility programs for reading card data tuples
	- Some documentation.

What it doesn't include is:

	- Configuration for brand XYZ PCMCIA cards
	- Drivers for brand XYZ PCMCIA cards
	- Diffs to modify standard drivers to handle card events

Essentially, this package contains everything required to
add PCMCIA support to FreeBSD 2.0. It does this via a
daemon that manages the PCMCIA slots via a PCIC driver. A configuration
file provides the daemon with the information required to setup
the specific cards, and to manage card insertion and removal.

This package has been tested on a NEC Versa Laptop.
The first version was developed on FreeBSD 1.1.5.1.

The main idea behind the package is for pcmciad to detect
inserted cards and match to a card ID in the config file,
then set up the I/O ports and memory window to the card
according to the data for the driver associated with the
card, then attach the kernel driver to the device. Shell
commands can be executed for both insertion and removal of cards,
and different commands can be executed for different cards,
drivers and devices.

Different kernel drivers may have to have some mods
done to recognise the card once installed; I have included
some diffs to `ed' that allows recognition of a `generic'
NS8390 card.

Some minor changes were made to ifconfig(8) to allow a
different ethernet address to be assigned to a network
interface, since each card may have different locations
the ethernet address is stored in.

This is a snapshot of a release for FreeBSD 2.0. It is
basically the 1.1.5.1 release ported for 2.0. I have only
just received a developer's guide for PCMCIA, so I should
have some more stable support soon.

For instructions on installation, see INSTALL.
There is a man entry on the daemon (pcmciad.8),
and the config file (pcmcia.conf.5).

Please send mail with any bugs or new card descriptions.

Enjoy!
