INSTALLATION
------------

1. Copy the source files from the sys directory into your
   /sys (or where-ever) tree. There are a number of .diff files
   that can be used to modify the following files:
	sys/conf/files
	sys/i386/i386/autoconf.c
	sys/i386/i386/conf.c
   There is also a sys/pccard directory that should reside in
   /sys/pccard

2. Make a symbolic link like:
	ln -s /sys/pccard /usr/include/pccard

3. Add a line in the kernel config file:

         controller crd0

   and rebuild the kernel. Optionally, the PCIC slot driver can
   and also built into the kernel by adding the line:

         device pcic0

4. Create a device for each slot e.g.

       foreach i (0 1)
	mknod /dev/card$i c 50 $i
	end

5. You can use lkm to load the PCIC controller. It can
   be unloaded at will. Once loaded, you should assign
   some memory via pccardmem for use with read/write.
   Normally cardd does this, but I haven't quite finished yet.
