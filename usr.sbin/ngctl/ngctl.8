.Sh NAME
.Nm ngctl
.Nd netgraph control utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ngctl
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl f Ar filename
.Op Fl n Ar nodename
.Op Ar command ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates a new netgraph node of type
.Em socket
which can be used to issue netgraph commands.
If no
.Fl f
flag is given, no
command is supplied on the command line, and standard input is a tty,
.Nm ngctl
will enter interactive mode. Otherwise
.Nm ngctl
will execute the supplied command(s) and exit immediately.
.Pp
Nodes can be created, removed, joined together, etc.
ASCII formatted control messages can be sent to any node if that node
supports binary/ASCII control message conversion.
.Pp
In interactive mode,
.Nm
will display any control messages and data packets received by the socket node.
In the case of control messages, the message arguments are displayed in ASCII
form if the originating node supports conversion.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f Ar nodeinfo
Read commands from the named file.
A single dash represents the standard input.
Blank lines and lines starting with a ``#'' are ignored.
.It Fl n Ar nodename
Assign
.Em nodename
to the newly created netgraph node. The default name is
.Em ngctlXXX
where XXX is the process ID number.
.It Fl d
Increase the debugging verbosity level.
