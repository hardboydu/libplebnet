.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Adduser 
is a simple program for adding new users. Adduser checks
the passwd, group and shell databases. It creates passwd/group entries,
HOME-directory, dotfiles and sends the new user a welcome message.
.Sh RESTRICTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Sy username
Login name. May contain only  lowercase characters or digits. Maximum length
is 16 characters (see 
.Xr setlogin 2
BUGS section). 
The reasons for this limit are "Historical". 
Given that people have traditionally wanted to break this
limit for aesthetic reasons, it's never been of great importance to break
such a basic fundamental parameter in UNIX.
You can change 
.Dv UT_NAMESIZE 
in 
.Pa /usr/include/utmp.h
and recompile the
world; people have done this and it works, but you will have problems
with any precompiled programs, or source that assumes the 8-character
name limit and NIS. The NIS protocol mandates an 8-character username.
If you need a longer login name for e-mail addresses,
you can define an alias in
.Pa /etc/aliases .
.It Sy fullname
Firstname and surname. 
The
.Ql Pa \:
character is not allowed.
.It Sy shell
Only valid shells from the shell database or sliplogin and pppd
.It Sy uid
Automatically generated or your choice, must be less than 32000.
.It Sy gid/login group
Your choice or automatically generated. 
.It Sy password
If not empty, password is encoded with 
.Xr crypt 3 .
.El
.Sh UNIQUE GROUPS
Perhaps you're missing what 
.Em can
be done with this scheme that falls apart
with most other schemes.  With each user in his/her own group the user can
safely run with a umask of 002 and have files created in their home directory
and not worry about others being able to read them.
.Pp
For a shared area you create a separate uid/gid (like cvs or ncvs on freefall),
you place each person that should be able to access this area into that new
group.
.Pp
This model of uid/gid administration allows far greater flexibility than lumping
users into groups and having to muck with the umask when working in a shared
area.
.Pp
I have been using this model for almost 10 years and found that it works
for most situations, and has never gotten in the way.  (Rod Grimes)
