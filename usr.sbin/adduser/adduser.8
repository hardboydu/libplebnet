.Sh UNIQ GROUP
Perhaps your missing what *can* be done with this scheme that falls apart
with most other schemes.  With each user in his/her own group the user can
safely run with a umask of 002 and have files created in there home directory
and not worry about others being able to read them.

For a shared area you create a seperate uid/gid (like cvs or ncvs on freefall),
you place each person that should be able to access this area into that new
group.

This model of uid/gid administration allows far greater flexibilty that lumping
users into groups and having to muck with the umask when working in a shared
area.

I have been using this model for almost 10 years and found that it works
for most situations, and has never gotten in the way.  (Rod Grimes)
