.Dt NFSV4 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm nfsv4
.Nd NFS Version 4 Protocol
.Sh SYNOPSIS
experimental client and server with NFSv4 support
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The experimental nfs client and server provides support for the
.Tn NFSv4
specification; see
.%T "Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Protocol \\*(tNRFC\\*(sP 3530" .
The protocol is somewhat similar to NFS Version 3, but differs in significant
ways. It uses a single Compound RPC that concatenates operations to-gether.
Each of these operations are similar to the RPCs of NFS Version 3.
The operations in the compound are performed in order, until one of
them fails (returns an error) and then the RPC terminates at that point.
.Pp
It has
integrated locking support, which implies that the server is no longer
stateless. As such, the
.Tn NFSv4
server remains in recovery mode for a Grace period (always greater than the
lease duration the server uses) after a reboot.
During this Grace period, clients may recover state but not perform other
open/lock state changing operations.
To provide for correct recovery semantics, a small file described by
.Xr stablerestart 5
is used by the server during the recovery phase. If this file is missing,
the server will not start.
If this file is lost, it should be recovered from backups, since creating
an empty
.Xr stablerestart 5
file will result in the server starting without providing a Grace Period
for recovery.
Note that recovery only occurs when the server
machine is rebooted, not when the
.Xr nfsd 8
are just restarted.
.Pp
It provides several optional features not in NFS Version 3:
.sp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
- NFS Version 4 ACLs
- Referrals, which redirect subtrees to other servers
  (not yet implemented)
- Delegations, which allow a client to operate on a file locally
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Tn NFSv4
protocol does not use a separate mount protocol and assumes that the
server provides a single file system tree structure, rooted at the point
in the local file system tree specified by the
.sp 1
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
V4: <rootdir>
.Ed
.sp 1
line in
.Xr exports 5 .
The
.Xr nfsd 8
allows a limited subset of operations to be performed on non-exported subtrees
of the local file system, so that traversal of the tree to the exported
subtrees is possible.
As such, the ``<rootdir>'' can be in a non-exported file system. However,
the entire tree that is rooted at that point must be in local file systems
that are of types that can be NFS exported.
Since the
.Nm
file system is rooted at ``<rootdir>'', setting this to anything other
than ``/'' will result in clients being required to use different mount
paths for
.Nm
than for NFS Version 2 or 3.
Unlike NFS Version 2 and 3, Version 4 allows a client mount to span across
multiple server file systems, although not all clients are capable of doing
this.
.Pp
.Nm
uses names for users and groups instead of numbers. On the wire, they
take the form:
.sp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
<user>@<dns.domain>
.Ed
.sp
where ``<dns.domain>'' is not the same as the DNS domain used
for host name lookups, but is usually set to the same string. Most systems set this ``<dns.domain>''
to the domain name part of the machine's
.Xr hostname 1
by default. However, this can normally be overridden by a command line
option or configuration file for the daemon used to do the name<->number
mapping.
On FreeBSD, the mapping daemon is called
.Xr nfsuserd 8
and has a command line option that overrides the domain component of the
machine's hostname.
This can be set in
.Xr rc.conf 5
via the nfsv4_userd_flags variable.
For use of
.Nm ,
either client or server, this daemon must be enabled by setting
.sp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
nfsv4_enable="YES"
.Ed
.sp
in
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
If this ``<dns.domain>'' is not set correctly or the daemon is not running, ``ls -l'' will typically
report a lot of ``nobody'' and ``nogroup'' ownerships.
.Pp
Although numbers are no longer used in the
.Nm
protocol, they will still be in the RPC authentication fields when running
using AUTH_SYS (sec=sys), which is the default.
As such, in this case both the user/group name and number spaces must
be consistent between the client and server.
.Pp
However, if you run
.Nm
with RPCSEC_GSS (sec=krb5, krb5i, krb5p), only names and KerberosV tickets
will go on the wire.
.Sh SERVER SETUP
.Pp
To set up the experimental nfs server that supports
.Nm
you will need to either build a kernel with:
.sp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
options	NFSD
.Ed
and not
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
options	NFSSERVER
.Ed
.sp
or start
.Xr mountd 8
and
.Xr nfsd 8
with the ``-4'' option to force use of the experimental server.
This will occur if
.sp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
nfsv4_enable="YES"
.Ed
.sp
is set in
.Xr rc.conf 5 ,
as above.
.Pp
You will also need to add a:
.sp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
V4: <rootdir>
.Ed
.sp
line to the
.Xr exports 5
file, to tell the server where the
.Nm
tree is rooted.
.Pp
If the file systems you are exporting are only being accessed via
.Nm
there are a couple of
.Xr sysctl 8
variables that you can change, which might improve performance.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm vfs.newnfs.issue_delegations
when set non-zero, allows the server to issue Open Delegations to
clients. These delegations permit the client to manipulate the file
locally on the client. Unfortunately, at this time, client use of
delegations is limited, so performance gains may not be observed.
This can only be enabled when the file systems being exported to
.Nm
clients are not being accessed locally on the server and, if being
accessed via NFS Version 2 or 3 clients, these clients cannot be
using the NLM.
.It Cm vfs.newnfs.enable_locallocks
can be set to 0 to disable acquisition of local byte range locks.
Disabling local locking can only be done if neither local accesses
to the exported file systems nor the NLM is operating on them.
.El
.sp
Note that Samba server access would be considered ``local access'' for the above
discussion.
.Pp
To build a kernel with the experimental
.Nm
linked into it, the
.sp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
options	NFSD
.Ed
.sp
must be specified in the kernel's
.Xr config 5
file.
.Sh CLIENT MOUNTS
.Pp
To do an
.Nm
mount, specify the ``nfsv4'' option on the
.Xr mount_nfs 8
command line.
This will force use of the experimental client plus set ``tcp'' and
.Nm .
.Pp
If the
.Nm
server that is being mounted on supports delegations, you can set
.sp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
nfsv4_callbackdaemon_enable="YES"
.Ed
.sp
via
.Xr rc.conf 5
so that the client side callback daemon
.Xr nfscbd 8
is started upon boot.
Without a functioning callback path, a server will never issue Delegations
to a client.
.sp
By default, the callback address will be set to the IP address acquired via
rtalloc() in the kernel and port# 7745.
To override the default port#, a command line option for
.Xr nfscbd 8
can be set via the variable
.sp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
nfsv4_callbackdaemon_flag
.Ed
.sp
using
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.sp
To get callbacks to work when behind a NAT gateway, a port for the callback
service will need to be set up on the NAT gateway and then the address
of the NAT gateway (host IP plus port#) will need to be set by assigning the
.Xr sysctl 8
variable vfs.newnfs.callback_addr to a string of the form:
.sp
N.N.N.N.N.N
.sp
where the first 4 Ns are the host IP address and the last two are the
port# in network byte order (all decimal #s in the range 0-255).
.Pp
To build a kernel with the experimental
.Nm
client linked into it, the option
.sp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
options	NFSCL
.Ed
.sp
must be specified in the kernel's
.Xr config 5
file.

.Sh BUGS
At this time, there is no recall of delegations for local file system
operations. As such, delegations should only be enabled for file systems
that are being used soley as NFS export volumes and are not being accessed
via local system calls nor services such as Samba.
