You can configure your system to assume that the battery-backed CMOS
clock is set to your local legal time rather than Universal or
Greenwich time.  When the system boots, the \`adjkerntz' program will
examine your current time, reverse-apply the timezone correction, and
then set the system's UTC time to the corrected value.  This approach
is NOT guaranteed to always work; in particular, if you reboot your
system during the transition from or to summer time, the calculation
is sometimes impossible, and wierd things may result.

For this reason, we recommend that, unless you absolutely positively
must leave your CMOS clock on local time, you set your CMOS clock to GMT.

Unless your local time is GMT, this probably means that your CMOS
clock is on local time.  In this case, the local times that you will
be shown will be incorrect.  You should either set your CMOS clock to
GMT, or select option 98 from the main menu after selecting a
timezone.

Welcome to `sysctl -n kern.ostype` `sysctl -n kern.osrelease`!

This program will help you select a default timezone for your users and
for system processes.
