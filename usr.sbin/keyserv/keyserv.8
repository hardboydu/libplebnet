.B keyserv
is a daemon that is used for storing the
private encryption keys of each
user logged into the system.
These encryption keys are used for accessing
secure network services such as secure NFS.
.P
Normally, root's key is read from the file
.B /etc/.rootkey
when the daemon is started.
This is useful during power-fail reboots
when no one is around to type a password. 
.P
If a client with no secret key calls 
.BR keyserv , 
then the key of user 
.B nobody 
is used instead as the default key.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B \-d 
Disable the use of default keys for
.BR nobody .
.TP
.B \-D 
Run in debugging mode and log all requests to 
.BR keyserv .
.TP
.B \-n
Root's secret key is not read from
.BR /etc/.rootkey .
Instead,
.B keyserv
prompts the user for the password to decrypt
root's key stored in the
.B /etc/publickey
database and then stores the decrypted key in
.B /etc/.rootkey
for future use.
This option is useful if the
.B /etc/.rootkey
file ever gets out of date or corrupted.
