.Dt WATCHDOGD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm watchdogd
.Nd Software watchdog daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl I Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility interfaces with the kernel's software watchdog facility to ensure
that the system is in a working state.
If
.Nm
is unable to interface with the kernel over a specific timeout,
the kernel will take actions to assist in debugging or restarting the computer.
.Pp
One possible circumstance which will cause a watchdog timeout is an interrupt
storm.
If this occurs,
.Nm
will no longer execute and thus the kernel's watchdog routines will take
action after a configurable timeout.
.Pp
Upon receiving the
.Dv SIGTERM
or
.Dv SIGINT
signals,
.Nm
will first instruct the kernel to no longer perform watchdog checks and then
will terminate. 
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility recognizes the following runtime options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl I Ar file"
.It Fl I Ar file
Write the process id of the
.Nm
utility in the specified file.
.It Fl d
Don't fork.
When this option is specified,
.Nm
will not fork into the background at startup.
