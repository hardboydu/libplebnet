.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility controls the operation of Aironet Arlan 655 wireless networking
devices via the
.Xr arl 4
driver.
Most of the parameters that can be changed are related to the
Aironet protocol which the Aironet Arlan 655 card implements.
The parameters include
the station name, the station operation mode 
.Ar (point to point or infrastructure) , 
and the network name of a service
set to join.
The
.Nm
utility can also be used to view the current NIC status, configuration
and to dump out the values of the card's statistics counters.
.Pp
The
.Ar iface
argument given to
.Nm
should be the logical interface name associated with the Aironet Arlan 655
device
.Li ( arl0 , arl1 ,
etc.) and must be specified.
.Sh OPTIONS
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar iface
Display current settings of specified wireless interface. 
This retrieves current card settings from the driver and prints 
them out. 
.It Ar iface Cm name Ar name 
Set 
.Ar Device Name . 
This 
parameter is used to establish a 15-byte ASCII name
for the Arlan 655 Client Card.
The 
.Ar Device Name 
is optional and may be left blank.
.Pp
If you choose to assign a name, while operating in 
.Ar TMA
mode, the name will appear in the Arlan Access Point's Registration Table.
Duplicate names are allowed. 
.It Ar iface Cm sid Ar SID 
Set
.Ar System Identifier.
The System Identifier 
.Ar (SID)
is a 4-byte, hexadecimal digit value that 
is attached to each packet sent out over the radio.
Establishing a 
.Ar SID
allows you to group nodes into a microcelluar network and exclude 
those nodes that are whiting radio range on other networks.
.Pp
The
.Ar SID
value must be an even number, cannot exceed ts and must start with
00 or 02.
Examples of valid SID values are: 00000102, 0200AA14, 00013A18,
007F6380.
The 
.Ar default 
SID is 
.Cm 00000002 .
.Pp
Since nodes will only receive packets from other nodes with a matching SID, 
you must make sure that the Arlan 655 Client Card is set the same SID as 
other nodes on your network. 
.It Ar iface Cm mode Ar mode ( Cm 640 | 655 )
Use
.Ar operating mode
parameter to specify whether you are operating in 
.Ar TMA , Non-TMA 
or
.Ar PSP
mode.
The 
.Ar default
setting is 
.Cm TMA
mode.

.El
.It Ar iface Cm priority Ar priority ( Cm normal, high, highest )
Use the
.Ar priority
parameter to set the priority of the Arlan 655 Radio Media Access Control 
the values are 
.Cm normal , high
or
.Cm highest .
The higher the priority set, the more likely this unit will be first 
to successfully transmit a packet when multiple units are trying 
to transmit at the same time.
.Pp
The percentage of units on your network that you set to values other than
.Dq normal
should be kept small - 10 percent or less.  
.It Ar iface Cm stat
Print internal Arlan 655 statistics block.
.It Ar iface Cm quality
Display the cached signal level and quality maintained by the
.Xr arl 4
driver.
The driver retains information about quality and level for packets
received from different hosts.
Also the driver extracts values from ACK packets.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
arlconfig arl0 name NODE1 sid 4 freq 2442 
arlconfig arl0 quality 
arlconfig arl0 stat

.Pp
You can configure the Arlan 655 card from /etc/start_if.arl0.
For example: 
.Pp
#!/bin/sh
/sbin/arlconfig arl0 sid 0x000002 freq 2412 spread 2000 mode 640
