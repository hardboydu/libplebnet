.Dt DES 3
.Os "FreeSec 1.0"
.Sh NAME
.Nm des
.Nd Trapdoor encryption
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
The
.Fa salt
introduces disorder in the
.Tn DES
algorithm in one of 16777216 or 4096 possible ways
(ie. with 24 or 12 bits: if bit
.Em i
of the
.Ar salt
is set, then bits
.Em i
and
.Em i+24
are swapped in the
.Tn DES
E-box output).
.Pp
The DES key is used to encrypt a 64-bit constant using
.Ar count
iterations of
.Tn DES .
The value returned is a
.Dv null Ns -terminated
string, 20 or 13 bytes (plus null) in length, consisting of the
.Ar salt
followed by the encoded 64-bit encryption.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypt 3
.Sh AVAILABILITY
.Pp
DES Crypt is only available if it has been added.  It is not available
by default.
.Sh HISTORY
A rotor-based
.Fn crypt
function appeared in
.At v6 .
The current style
.Fn crypt
first appeared in
.At v7 .
.Pp
The DES section of the code (FreeSec 1.0) was developed outside the United
States of America as an unencumbered replacement for the U.S.-only NetBSD
libcrypt encryption library.
Users should be aware that this code (and programs staticly linked with it)
may not be exported from the U.S., although it apparently can be imported.
