.TH curs_delch 3 ""
.SH NAME
\fBdelch\fR, \fBwdelch\fR, \fBmvdelch\fR, 
\fBmvwdelch\fR - delete character under the cursor in a \fBncurses\fR window
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <ncurses.h>\fR

\fBint delch(void);\fR
.br
\fBint wdelch(WINDOW *win);\fR
.br
\fBint mvdelch(int y, int x);\fR
.br
\fBint mvwdelch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines delete the character under the cursor; all characters to the
right of the cursor on the same line are moved to the left one position and the
last character on the line is filled with a blank.  The cursor position does
not change (after moving to \fIy\fR, \fIx\fR, if specified).  (This does not
imply use of the hardware delete character feature.)
.SH RETURN VALUE
All routines return the integer \fBERR\fR upon failure and an integer value
other than \fBERR\fR upon successful completion.
.SH NOTES
Note that \fBdelch\fR, \fBmvdelch\fR, and \fBmvwdelch\fR may be macros.
