.SH NAME
\fBinch\fR, \fBwinch\fR, \fBmvinch\fR, 
\fBmvwinch\fR - get a character and attributes from a \fBncurses\fR window
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <ncurses.h>\fR

\fBchtype inch(void);\fR
.br
\fBchtype winch(WINDOW *win);\fR

\fBchtype mvwinch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines return the character, of type \fBchtype\fR, at the current
position in the named window.  If any attributes are set for that position,
their values are OR-ed into the value returned.  Constants defined in
\fB<ncurses.h>\fR can be used with the \fB&\fR (logical AND) operator to
extract the character or attributes alone.

.SS Attributes
The following bit-masks may be AND-ed with characters returned by \fBwinch\fR.

.nf
\fBA_CHARTEXT\fR     Bit-mask to extract character
\fBA_ATTRIBUTES\fR   Bit-mask to extract attributes
\fBA_COLOR\fR        Bit-mask to extract color-pair field information

.SH NOTES
