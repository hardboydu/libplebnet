.Sh NAME
.Nm remainder ,
.Nm remainderf
.Nd minimal residue functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn remainder "double x" "double y"
.Ft float
.Fn remainderf "float x" "float y"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn remainder
and
.Fn remainderf
return the remainder
.Fa r
:=
.Fa x
\-
.Fa n\(**y
where
.Fa n
is the integer nearest the exact value of
.Bk -words
.Fa x Ns / Ns Fa y ;
.Ek
moreover if
.Pf \\*(Ba Fa n
\-
.Sm off
.Fa x No / Fa y No \\*(Ba
.Sm on
=
1/2
then
.Fa n
is even.
Consequently
the remainder is computed exactly and
.Sm off
.Pf \\*(Ba Fa r No \\*(Ba
.Sm on
\*(Le
.Sm off
.Pf \\*(Ba Fa y No \\*(Ba/2 .
.Sm on
But
.Fn remainder x 0
and
.Fn remainder \*(If 0
are invalid operations that produce a \*(Na.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fmod 3 ,
.Xr ieee 3 ,
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn remainder
and
.Fn remainderf
routines conform to
.St -isoC-99
and
.St -ieee754 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn remainder
and
.Fn remainderf
functions appeared in
.Bx 4.3
and
.Fx 2.0 ,
respectively.
