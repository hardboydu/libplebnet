.Sh NAME
.Nm emalloc , ecalloc , erealloc , estrdup
.Nd non-failing memory allocation functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libutil
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <libutil.h>
.Ft void *
.Fn emalloc "size_t size"
.Ft void *
.Fn ecalloc "size_t number" "size_t size"
.Ft void *
.Fn erealloc "void *ptr" "size_t size"
.Ft char *
.Fn estrdup "const char *str"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions work as
.Fn malloc ,
.Fn calloc ,
.Fn realloc ,
and
.Fn strdup ,
except that they never return
.Dv NULL ,
but instead call
.Fn errx
to abort the program if memory allocation fails.
