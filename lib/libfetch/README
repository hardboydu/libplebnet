This is the new fetch(3) library, which is to replace the ftpio(3)
library and provide a new, unified backend for all fetch(1),
pkg_add(1) and sysinstall(8).

Note that this is very much work in progress. It compiles (with a few
warnings), but there is much left to be implemented. Comments, patches
etc. of all kinds are welcome, but please don't commit anything
without talking to me first.
