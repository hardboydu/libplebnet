This is the new fetch(3) library, which is to replace the ftpio(3)
library and provide a new, unified backend for all fetch(1),
pkg_add(1) and sysinstall(8).

Note that this is very much work in progress. It compiles (with a few
warnings), but there is much left to be implemented. Amongst other
items:

  * The man page needs work. Really. I mean it. Now.

  * ftp.c is not even half-written.

  * HTTP authentication doesn't work. I'm not sure if I bungled http.c
    or fubared base64.c (which was ripped from MIT fetch(1)).

  * The library needs a decent interface for reporting errors. I've
    started on something (sending back an error code in the url_t that
    was sent in) but we're Not There (tm) yet.

Comments, patches etc. of all kinds are welcome, but please don't
commit anything without talking to me first.
