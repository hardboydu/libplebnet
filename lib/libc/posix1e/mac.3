.Dt MAC 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm mac
.Nd introduction to the POSIX.1e MAC security API
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/mac.h
.Pp
In the kernel configuration file:
.Cd "options MAC"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fx
permits administrators to define Mandatory Access Control labels
defining levels for the privacy and integrity of data,
overriding discretionary policies
for those objects.
Not all objects currently provide support for MAC labels,
and MAC support must be explicitly enabled by the administrator.
The library calls include routines to retrieve, duplicate,
and set MAC labels associated with files and processes.
.Pp
POSIX.1e describes a set of MAC manipulation routines
to manage the contents of MAC labels,
as well as their relationships with
files and processes;
almost all of these support routines
are implemented in
.Fx .
.Pp
Available functions, sorted by behavior, include:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fn mac_get_fd
This function is described in
.Xr mac_get 3 ,
and may be used to retrieve the
MAC label associated with
a specific file descriptor.
.It Fn mac_get_file
This function is described in
.Xr mac_get 3 ,
and may be used to retrieve the
MAC label associated with
a named file.
.It Fn mac_get_proc
This function is described in
.Xr mac_get 3 ,
and may be used to retrieve the
MAC label associated with
the calling process.
.It Fn mac_set_fd
This function is described in
.Xr mac_set 3 ,
and may be used to set the
MAC label associated with
a specific file descriptor.
.It Fn mac_set_file
This function is described in
.Xr mac_set 3 ,
and may be used to set the
MAC label associated with
a named file.
.It Fn mac_set_proc
This function is described in
.Xr mac_set 3 ,
and may be used to set the
MAC label associated with
the calling process.
.It Fn mac_free
This function is described in
.Xr mac_free 3 ,
and may be used to free
userland working MAC label storage.
.It Fn mac_from_text
This function is described in
.Xr mac_text 3 ,
and may be used to convert
a text-form MAC label
into a working
.Vt mac_t .
.It Fn mac_to_text
This function is described in
.Xr mac_text 3 ,
and may be used to convert a
.Vt mac_t
into a text-form MAC label.

.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Fx Ns 's
support for POSIX.1e interfaces and features
is still under development
at this time.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mac_free 3 ,
.Xr mac_get 3 ,
.Xr mac_set 3 ,
.Xr mac_text 3 ,
.Xr mac 9
.Sh STANDARDS
POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.
Discussion of the draft
continues on the cross-platform POSIX.1e implementation mailing list.
To join this list, see the
.Fx
POSIX.1e implementation page
for more information.
.Sh BUGS
The TrustedBSD MAC Framework and associated policies, interfaces, and
applications are considered to be an experimental feature in
.Fx .
Sites considering production deployment should keep the experimental
status of these services in mind during any deployment process.
See also
.Xr mac 9
for related considerations regarding the kernel framework.
