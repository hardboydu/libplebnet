.Dt CAP_GET_PROC 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cap_get_proc
.Nd obtain the current process capability state
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/capability.h>
.Ft cap_t
.Fn cap_get_proc "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function
.Fn cap_get_proc
shall allocate a capability state in working storage, set its state to that
of the calling process, and return a pointer to the newly created
capability state.
.Pp
This function may cause memory to be allocated.
The caller should free any releasable memory, when the capability state in
the working storage is no longer required, by calling
.Fn cap_free
with the cap_t as an argument.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Fx Ns 's
support for POSIX.1e interfaces and features is still under
development at this time.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, this function shall return a cap_t value.
Otherwise, a value of
.Dv NULL
shall be returned and
.Va errno
shall be set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn cap_get_proc
function shall return
.Dv NULL
and set
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The capability state to be returned requires more memory than is allowed
by the hardware or system-imposed memory management constraints.

.Sh STANDARDS
POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.  Discussion
of the draft continues on the cross-platform POSIX.1e implementation
mailing list.  To join this list, see the
.Fx
POSIX.1e implementation
page for more information.
.Sh HISTORY
Support for POSIX.1e Capabilities was developed as part of the TrustedBSD
Project.
POSIX.1e Capability support was introduced in
.Fx 5.0 ,
and development continues.

.Sh BUGS
While libposix1e is fully implemented, supporting kernel code is not
yet available in the base distribution.
It is slated for inclusion prior to 5.0-RELEASE.
