.Sh NAME
.Nm cap_copy_int
.Nd Convert an External Capability Representation to a Capability State in
Working Storage
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/capability.h>
.Ft cap_t
.Fn cap_copy_int "void *ext_p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function converts an external capability representation as returned by
.Nm cap_copy_ext
in the memory that
.Va ext_p
points to to a handle to a capability state in working storage.
.Pp
This function may cause memory to be allocated.
The caller should free any releasable memory, when the capability state
in working memory is no longer required, by calling
.Xr cap_free 3
with the
.Va cap_t
as an argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Nm
function returns a handle to a capability state in working storage.
On error, it returns
.Va (cap_t)NULL
and sets
.Va errno
appropriately.
.Sh ERRORS
The following
.Dv errno
values can be set by
.Nm cap_copy_ext :
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Va ext_p
does not refer to an external representation as returned by
.Xr cap_copy_ext 3
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Not enough memory could be allocated in the working storage to hold the
capability state.
