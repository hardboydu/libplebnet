.Sh NAME
.Nm cap_copy_int
.Nd convert an external capability representation to a capability state in
working storage
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/capability.h
.Ft cap_t
.Fn cap_copy_int "void *ext_p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cap_copy_int
function converts an external capability representation (as returned by
.Xr cap_copy_ext 3 )
in the buffer pointed to by
.Fa ext_p
to a handle to a capability state in working storage.
.Pp
This function may cause memory to be allocated.
The caller should free any releasable memory, when the capability state
in working memory is no longer required, by calling
.Xr cap_free 3
with the
.Vt cap_t
as an argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn cap_copy_int
function returns a handle to a capability state in working storage.
Otherwise,
.Dv NULL
is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn cap_copy_int
fails if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa ext_p
does not refer to an external representation as returned by
.Xr cap_copy_ext 3 .
.It Bq Er ENOMEM

has failed.
