.Dt MAC_TEXT 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm mac_from_text ,
.Nm mac_to_text
.Nd convert MAC label to/from text representation
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/mac.h
.Ft mac_t
.Fn mac_from_text "const char *text_p"
.Ft "char *"
.Fn mac_to_text "mac_t label" "size_t *len_p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mac_from_text
function converts the text representation of a label
into a
.Vt mac_t ,
which must later be freed with
.Xr mac_free .
The
.Fn mac_to_text
function returns
the text representation of
.Fa label
and sets
.Fa *len_p
to the length of the returned string.
.Pp
Refer to
.Xr maclabel 7
for the MAC label format.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn mac_from_text
function returns a valid
.Vt mac_t
equivalent to
the MAC label described in
.Fa text_p
upon success, and
.Dv NULL
upon failure, setting
.Va errno
to indicate the error.
.Pp
The
.Fn mac_to_text
function returns a string
containing the text representation of
.Fa label
upon success, and
.Dv NULL
upon failure, setting
.Va errno
to indicate the error.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
POSIX.1e does not define
a text format for text representations
of MAC labels.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
An invalid policy or qualifier
was specified in
.Fa text_p ,
or an invalid MAC label
was specified in
.Fa label .
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Insufficient memory was available
to allocate internal storage.
