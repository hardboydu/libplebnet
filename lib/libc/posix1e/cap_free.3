.Sh NAME
.Nm cap_free
.Nd "release memory allocated to a capability state in working storage"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/capability.h>
.Ft int
.Fn cap_free "void *obj_d"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function
.Fn cap_free
shall free any releasable memory currently allocated to the capability
state in working storage identified by
.Va obj_d .
The
.Va obj_d
argument may identify either a cap_t entity, or a char * entity allocated
by the
.Fn cap_to_text
function.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Fx Ns 's
support for POSIX.1e interfaces and features is still under
development at this time.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the function shall return a value of zero.
Otherwise, a value of -1 shall be returned and
.Va errno
set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS

.Sh STANDARDS
POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.  Discussion
of the draft continues on the cross-platform POSIX.1e implementation
mailing list.  To join this list, see the
.Fx
POSIX.1e implementation
page for more information.
.Sh HISTORY
Support for POSIX.1e Capabilities was developed as part of the TrustedBSD
Project.
POSIX.1e Capability support was introduced in
.Fx 5.0 ,
and development continues.
