.Dt CAP_SET_FLAG 3
.Os FreeBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm cap_set_flag
.Nd Set the Value of a Capability Flag
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/capability.h>
.Ft int
.Fn cap_set_flag "cap_t cap_p" "cap_flag_t flag" "int ncap" "cap_value_t caps[]" "cap_flag_value_t value"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function shall set the flag
.Ar flag
of each capability in the array
.Ar caps
in the capability state in working storage identified by
.Ar cap_p
to
.Ar value .
The argument
.Ar ncap
is used to specify the number of capabilities in the array
.Ar caps .
Implementations may place restrictions on the setting of the flags in a capability state.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
FreeBSD's support for POSIX.1e interfaces and features is still under
development at this time.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, this function shall return a value of zero.
Otherwise, a value of -1 shall be returned, and
.Ar errno
shall be set to indicate the error.
The capability state identified by
.Ar cap_p
shall not be affected if the return value is -1.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn cap_set_flag
function shall return -1 and set
.Ar errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
At least one of the values of
.Ar cap_p ,
.Ar ncap ,
.Ar flag
and
.Ar value ,
or at least one of the first
.Ar ncap
elements in
.Ar caps ,
does not refer to the corresponding entity.
.Pp
The resulting capability state identified by
.Ar cap_p
violates one or more implementation restrictions.

.Sh STANDARDS
POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.  Discussion
of the draft continues on the cross-platform POSIX.1e implementation
mailing list.  To join this list, see the
.Fx
POSIX.1e implementation
page for more information.
.Sh HISTORY
Support for POSIX.1e Capabilities was developed as part of the TrustedBSD
Project.
POSIX.1e Capability support was introduced in
.Fx 5.0 ,
and development continues.
