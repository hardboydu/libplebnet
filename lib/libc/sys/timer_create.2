.Dt TIMER_CREATE 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm timer_create
.Nd create a per-process timer (REALTIME)
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In time.h
.Ft int
.Fn timer_create "clockid_t clockid" "struct sigevent *restrict evp" "timer_t *restrict timerid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn timer_create
function creates a per-process timer using the specified clock,
.Fa clock_id ,
as the timing base. The
.Fn timer_create
function returns, in the location referenced by
.Fa timerid ,
a timer ID of type timer_t used to identify the timer in timer requests.
This timer ID is unique within the calling process until the timer is deleted.
The particular clock,
.Fa clock_id ,
is defined in
.In time.h .
The timer whose ID is returned is in a disarmed state upon return from
.Fn timer_create .
.Pp
The
.Fa evp
argument, if non-NULL, points to a sigevent structure. This structure,
allocated by the application, defines the asynchronous notification to occur
when the timer expires. If the
.Fa evp
argument is NULL, the effect is as if the evp argument pointed to a sigevent
structure with the sigev_notify member having the value SIGEV_SIGNAL, the
sigev_signo having a default signal number, and the sigev_value member having
the value of the timer ID.
.Pp
The implementations supports a clock_id of CLOCK_REALTIME or CLOCK_MONOTONIC.
.Pp
If evp->sigev_sigev_notify is SIGEV_THREAD and sev->sigev_notify_attributes
is not NULL, if the attribute pointed to by sev->sigev_notify_attributes has
a thread stack address specified by a call to
.Fn pthread_attr_setstack
or
.Fn pthread_attr_setstackaddr ,
the results are unspecified if the signal is generated more than once.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the call succeeds,
.Fn timer_create
returns zero and update the location referenced by
.Fa timerid
to a timer_t, which can be passed to the per-process timer calls. If an error
occurs, the function shall return a value of -1 and set errno to indicate the
error. The value of timerid is undefined if an error occurs.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn timer_create
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The calling process has already created all of the timers it is allowed by
this implementation
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The specified clock ID is not supported.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
Any arguments point outside the allocated address space or there is a
memory protection fault.

.Xr timer_delete 2 ,
.Xr timer_getoverun 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn timer_create
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-96 .
