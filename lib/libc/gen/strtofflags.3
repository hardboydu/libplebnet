.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft char *
.Fn fflagstostr "u_long flags" "char *def"
.Ft int
.Fn strtofflags "char **stringp" "u_long *setp" "u_long *clrp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fflagstostr
function returns a comma separated string of the file flags represented by
.Fa flags .
If no flags are set the string
.Fa def
is returned instead.
.Pp
The
.Fn strtofflags
function takes a string of file flags, as described in
.Xr chflags 1 ,
parses it, and returns the 'set' flags and 'clear' flags
such as would be given as arguments to
.Xr chflags 2 .
On success
.Fn strtofflags
returns 0, otherwise it returns non-zero and
.Fa stringp
is left pointing to the offending token.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chflags 1 ,
.Xr chflags 2 ,
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn strtofflags
and
.Fn fflagstostr
functions first appeared in
.Fx 4.0 .
