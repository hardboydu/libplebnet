.SH NAME
pam_krb5 \- Kerberos 5 PAM module
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B /usr/lib/pam_krb5.so
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "pam_krb5" "" "\fLpam_krb5\fP \(em Kerberos 5 PAM module"
.PP
The Kerberos 5 service module for PAM, typically
.BR /usr/lib/pam_krb5.so ,
provides functionality for three PAM categories:
authentication,
account management,
and password management.
It also provides null functions for session management.
The
.B pam_krb5.so
module is a shared object
that can be dynamically loaded to provide
the necessary functionality upon demand.
Its path is specified in the
.SM PAM
configuration file.
.SH Kerberos 5 Authentication Module
The Kerberos 5 authentication component
provides functions to verify the identity of a user.
(\f3pam_sm_authenticate(\|)\f1)
and to set user specific credentials
(\f3pam_sm_setcred(\|)\f1).
.B pam_sm_authenticate(\|)
converts the supplied username into a Kerberos principal,
by appending the default local realm name.
It also supports usernames with explicit realm names.
If a realm name is supplied, then upon a sucessful return, it
changes the username by mapping the principal name into a local username
(calling \f3krb5_aname_to_localname()\f1). This typically just means
the realm name is stripped.
.LP
It prompts the user for a password and obtains a new Kerberos TGT for
the principal. The TGT is verified by obtaining a service
ticket for the local host.
.LP
When prompting for the current password, the authentication
module will use the prompt "Password for <principal>: ".
.LP
The
.B pam_sm_setcred(\|)
function stores the newly acquired credentials in a credentials cache,
and sets the environment variable
.B KRB5CCNAME
appropriately.
The credentials cache should be destroyed by the user at logout with
.BR kdestroy (1) .
.LP
The following options may be passed to the authentication module:
.TP 15
.B debug
.BR syslog (3)
debugging information at
.SB LOG_DEBUG
level.
.TP
.B use_first_pass
If the authentication module is not the first in the stack,
and a previous module obtained the user's password, that password is
used to authenticate the user. If this fails, the authentication
module returns failure without prompting the user for a password.
This option has no effect if the authentication module is
the first in the stack, or if no previous modules obtained the
user's password.
.TP
.B try_first_pass
This option is similar to the
.B use_first_pass
option, except that if the previously obtained password fails, the
user is prompted for another password.
.TP
.B forwardable
Obtain forwardable Kerberos credentials for the user.
.TP
.B no_ccache
Do not save the obtained credentials in a credentials cache. This is a
useful option if the authentication module is used for services such
as ftp or pop, where the user would not be able to destroy them. [This
is not a recommendation to use the module for those services.]
.TP
.B ccache=<name>
Use <name> as the credentials cache. <name> must be in the form
.IR type:residual .
The special tokens
.BR %u ,
to designate the decimal uid of the user;
and
.BR %p ,
to designate the current process id; can be used in <name>.
.SH Kerberos 5 Account Management Module
The Kerberos 5 account management component
provides a function to perform account management,
.BR pam_sm_acct_mgmt(\|) .
The function verifies that the authenticated principal is allowed
to login to the local user account by calling
.B krb5_kuserok()
(which checks the user's \&.k5login file).
.SH Kerberos 5 Password Management Module
The Kerberos 5 password management component
provides a function to change passwords
(\f3pam_sm_chauthtok(\|)\f1). The username supplied (the
user running the
.BR passwd (1)
command, or the username given as an argument) is mapped into
a Kerberos principal name, using the same technique as in
the authentication module. Note that if a realm name was
explicitly supplied during authentication, but not during
a password change, the mapping
done by the password management module may not result in the
same principal as was used for authentication.
.LP
Unlike when
changing a unix password, the password management module will
allow any user to change any principal's password (if the user knows
the principal's old password, of course). Also unlike unix, root
is always prompted for the principal's old password.
.LP
The password management module uses the same heuristics as
.BR kpasswd (1)
to determine how to contact the Kerberos password server.
.LP
The following options may be passed to the password management
module:
.TP 15
.B debug
.BR syslog (3)
debugging information at
.SB LOG_DEBUG
level.
.TP
.B use_first_pass
If the password management module is not the first in the stack,
and a previous module obtained the user's old password, that password is
used to authenticate the user. If this fails, the password
management
module returns failure without prompting the user for the old password.
If successful, the new password entered to the previous module is also
used as the new Kerberos password. If the new password fails,
the password management module returns failure without
prompting the user for a new password.
.TP
.B try_first_pass
This option is similar to the
.B use_first_pass
option, except that if the previously obtained old or new passwords fail,
the user is prompted for them.
.SH Kerberos 5 Session Management Module
The Kerberos 5 session management component
provides functions to initiate
(\f3pam_sm_open_session(\|)\f1)
and terminate
(\f3pam_sm_close_session(\|)\f1)
sessions. Since session management is not defined under Kerberos 5,
both of these functions simply return success. They are provided
only because of the naming conventions for PAM modules.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP "\w'.SM KRB5CCNAME\ \ 'u"
.SM KRB5CCNAME
Location of the credentials cache.
.SH FILES
.TP "\w'/tmp/krb5cc_[uid]\ \ 'u"
/tmp/krb5cc_[uid]
default credentials cache ([uid] is the decimal UID of the user).
.TP
~/\&.k5login
file containing Kerberos principals that are allowed access.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR kdestroy (1),
.BR passwd (1),
.BR pam (8),
.BR syslog (3),
.BR pam.conf (5).
.SH NOTES
Applications should not call
.B pam_authenticate()
more than once between calls to
.B pam_start()
and
.B pam_end()
when using the Kerberos 5 PAM module.
