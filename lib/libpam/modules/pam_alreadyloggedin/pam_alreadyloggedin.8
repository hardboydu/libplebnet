.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_alreadyloggedin
.Nd Already-logged-in PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_alreadyloggedin
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Already-logged-in authentication service module for PAM,
.Nm
provides functionality for only one PAM category:
authentication.
In terms of the
.Ar module-type
parameter, this is the
.Dq Li auth
feature.
It also provides null functions for other PAM categories.
.Ss Already-logged-in Authentication Module
The Already-logged-in authentication component
.Pq Fn pam_sm_authenticate ,
returns success if and only if the target user's ID is identical to a current login specified in the
.Xr utmp 5
database and verified with matching permissions on that login's respective terminal in
.Pa /dev .
If a user shows up in
.Xr w 8
output, they will generally be allowed to authenticate using this method.
.Pp
The following options may be passed to the authentication module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm restrict_tty Ns = Ns Ar ttyfoo*"
.It Cm no_root
Never allow login with a target user ID of zero.
.It Cm restrict_tty Ns = Ns Ar ttyglob*
Only allow login if the terminal device currently being authenticated on matches
.Ar ttyglob* .
The
.Ar ttyglob*
argument is specified as a shell glob, and checked using the
.Xr fnmatch 3 
function.
