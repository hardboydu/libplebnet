Functional completeness:
- aio support

Robustness:
- tracking kernel file descriptors
- properly handling mixed descriptors in kqueue, poll, and select

Performance:
- create user level rwlocks that support full kernel rwlock semantics 
  (recursive write acquisition, downgrade, etc)

Generality of use:
- handling fork
- conditional compilation of ipv4 and ipv6
- initializing individual proc struct per pid for RPC functions
- enabling compilation of SCTP
- libnetstat for providing netstat interface to stack

open issues:
- connecting to the IP address of the kernel stack (use tap device)
- signal I/O notifications
- efficiently handling mixed kernel / user descriptors in select, kqueue, and poll
