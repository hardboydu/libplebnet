In spite of its name implying a lack of privilege, libplebnet currently relies
on bpf for its virtual ethernet interface, programs linked against libplebnet 
need to be run as root. Work on ubpf (user / unprivileged bpf) is in progress,
but the read / write filters still need to be debugged.

The following environment variables need to be set:
PLEBCONF_PATH: the path to libplebconf.so
RC_CONF: the fully qualified path including the name of the file to be used 
	for configuring the virtual interface and route
BPFIF: the interface that the virtual ethernet should bind to for sending and
	receiving packets (BPF interface)

The file "config" provides an example of how these are set in my environment
inside vmware player. The file "myrc.conf" is the rc.conf file that I use for
testing.

regression/test.c tests that the stack gets started.

regression/tcpconnect.c is the same file taken from tools, but linked against
libplebnet.
