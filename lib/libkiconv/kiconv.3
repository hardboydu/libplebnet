.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr kiconv 3
library provides multi-byte character conversion tables for kernel side
iconv service.
.Pp
.Fn kiconv_add_xlat16_cspair
defines a conversion table using
.Xr iconv 3
between
.Ar fromcode
charset and
.Ar tocode
charset. You can specify
.Ar flag
to determine if
.Xr tolower 3
/
.Xr toupper 3
conversion is included in the table.
The
.Ar flag
has following values.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "KICONV_FROM_LOWER" -compact
.It Fa KICONV_LOWER
.It Fa KICONV_FROM_LOWER
It generates a tolower table in addition to a character conversion table.
The difference between two is tolower
.Ar tocode
or tolower
.Ar fromcode .
.It Fa KICONV_UPPER
.It Fa KICONV_FROM_UPPER
It generates a toupper table in addition to a character conversion table.
The difference between two is toupper
.Ar tocode
or toupper
.Ar fromcode .
.El
.Pp
A tolower/toupper conversion is limited to single-byte characters.
.Pp
.Fn kiconv_add_xlat16_cspairs
defines two conversion tables which are from
.Ar localcode
to
.Ar foreigncode
and from
.Ar foreigncode
to
.Ar localcode .
This conversion tables also contain both of tolower and toupper tables.
.Pp
.Fn kiconv_add_xlat16_table
defines a conversion table directly pointed by
.Ar data
whose length is
.Ar datalen ,
not using
.Xr iconv 3 .
