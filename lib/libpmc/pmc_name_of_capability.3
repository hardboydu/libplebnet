.Sh DESCRIPTION
These convenience functions translate numeric constants used by the
.Lb libpmc
to
.Vt "const char *"
pointers to human readable representations of their arguments.
.Pp
Function
.Fn pmc_name_of_capability
translates a PMC capability flag given in argument
.Fa pc
to a human readable string.
PMC capabilities are described in
.Xr pmc 3 .
.Pp
Function
.Fn pmc_name_of_class
translates the PMC class value specified in argument
.Fa pc
to a human readable name.
PMC classes are described in
.Xr pmc 3 .
.Pp
Function
.Fn pmc_name_of_cputype
translates the CPU type value specified in argument
.Fa ct
to a human readable name.
CPU types known to the library are described in
.Xr pmc 3 .
.Pp
Function
.Fn pmc_name_of_disposition
translates the PMC row disposition specified in argument
.Fa pd
to a human readable name.
PMC row dispositions are described in
.Xr hwpmc 4 .
.Pp
Function
.Fn pmc_name_of_event
translates the PMC event number specified by argument
.Fa pe
to a string.
PMC event names are documented in section
.Sx EVENT SPECIFIERS
of
.Xr pmc 3 .
.Pp
Function
.Fn pmc_name_of_mode
translates the PMC mode specified by argument
.Fa pm
to a human readable string.
PMC modes are described in
.Xr pmc 3 .
.Pp
Function
.Fn pmc_name_of_state
translates the value of argument
.Fa ps
to a human readable name.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The returned pointers point to static storage inside the PMC
library and should not be freed by the caller.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return a non-NULL pointer on successful completion.
In case of an error, a NULL pointer is returned and the global
variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
A call to these functions may fail with the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The function argument specified an invalid value.
