# All library objects contain FreeBSD revision strings by default; they may be
# excluded as a space-saving measure.  To produce a library that does
# not contain these strings, add -DSTRIP_FBSDID (see <sys/cdefs.h>) to CFLAGS
# below.  Note, there are no IDs for syscall stubs whose sources are generated.
# To included legacy CSRG sccsid strings, add -DLIBC_SCCS and -DSYSLIBC_SCCS
# (for system call stubs) to CFLAGS below.  -DSYSLIBC_SCCS affects just the
# system call stubs.
